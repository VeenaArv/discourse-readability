Method (computer science)

In object-oriented programming, a method is a part of an object. A method allows the object to perform an action, whether this action is to modify itself or to return a value. An example is:
public int getOne() {

This syntax is the same in different programming languages such as Java and C#.

The codice_ identifier means that this method is publicly accessible, that anyone is allowed to use this. In comparison, a method may be codice_ or sometimes codice_, the latter of which means only specific parts of the same program are allowed to use this method, and never a human user. A privately accessible method only allows the object it belongs to, to edit it. This is used to give data security.

The codice_ identifier means that the return type is an integer value.
