According to an interview from Virgin Records, the band's name;"Actually comes
from a thesis that the band found online that was written by a former Harvard professor. And one of the subsections of the
thesis was titled "Thirty Seconds to Mars" and he goes on to talk about the exponential growth of technology that relates to humans and saying that we are quite literally thirty seconds to mars. What it means to us is, we thought it best described our music, in short."
