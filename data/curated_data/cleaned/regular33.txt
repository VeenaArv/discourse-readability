In , the Washington Territory Legislature established the State School for Defective Youth in Vancouver, Washington. The act established a "school for the deaf, mute, blind, and feeble minded". Louis Sohns and Charles Brown raised money from local civic leaders, purchased property, and built buildings for the school. They were also added as trustees for the school.

In , School Director James Watson recommended that the "feeble minded" be separated from the blind and deaf students. They were relocated to another facility nearby. In , the "feeble minded" were relocated to a state school at Medical Lake in Eastern Washington (now called Lakeland Village). The Vancouver school's name was changed to the State School for the Deaf and Blind, with the blind students moved to the former facility for the "feeble minded".

In , the two schools were officially separated by names, the State School for the Blind, and the State School for the Deaf.

Jazz singer and pianist Diane Schuur, blind since birth from retinopathy of prematurity, attended the Washington State School for the Blind from ages four to seven, in the late s to early s. She lived in Vancouver at the school but was able to commute home by train to suburban Seattle on her own. In her twenties, her talent was recognized by jazz musicians Dizzie Gillespie and Stan Getz. She has made over  albums including the Grammy-winning Diane Schuur & the Count Basie Orchestra. She has performed at Carnegie Hall, The White House and the Kennedy Center. Schuur was awarded the Helen Keller Achievement Award in  by the American Foundation for the Blind.
