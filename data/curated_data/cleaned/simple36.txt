Daguerreotype

A Daguerreotype is a method of creating photographs that is no longer in general use. A man called Louis-Jacques-Mand√© Daguerre invented the daguerreotype process in France in . 

The new type of photography became very popular very quickly as it was capable of capturing a "truthful likeness." By , there were over seventy daguerreotype studios in New York alone.

However the popularity of the daguerreotype was short lived as other cheaper processes were invented. By the late s faster and less expensive processes such as the ambrotype, became available. A drawback of the Daguerreotype was that there was no negative from which to produce lots of images. Each picture was therefore unique, the only way to get a copy was to rephotograph the image.
