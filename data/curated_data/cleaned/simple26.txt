St John Passion

The St John Passion () is a musical composition by Johann Sebastian Bach. The words tell the story of Jesus’s death on the cross as told in the Book of St John in the Bible. The work is for a choir, solo voices and orchestra.

The "St. John Passion" was first performed in  in the St Nicholas Church, Leipzig. The words are from three sources: the Bible (telling the story), by two poets from Hamburg, mostly by Barthold Heinrich Brockes, and from chorales which were well-known to German church goers at the time. There were other composers who also wrote works called "St John Passion", the most famous being Heinrich Schütz. However, Bach’s "St John Passion " is thought by many musicians to be one of the greatest choral works ever written. Two other very great choral works by Bach are his "St Matthew Passion " and "Mass in B minor ".
