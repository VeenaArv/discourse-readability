Jacques and November

Jacques and November () is a  Canadian drama film directed by Jean Beaudry and François Bouvier. The film was selected as the Canadian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.

The film stars Beaudry as Jacques Landry, a man in his early s who is dying of an unspecified incurable disease and documenting his thoughts on mortality in a video diary; simultaneously, his friend Denis (Pierre Rousseau) is trying to make a higher-budget documentary film about him. 

Critics largely analyzed the film not as focusing on death as such, but as an affirming and uplifting look at the meaning that friends and family bring to life. Although Jacques Landry's terminal illness was not specified in the film, the LGBT magazine "The Body Politic" reviewed it as an HIV/AIDS allegory, directly comparing and contrasting its views of mortality with the contemporaneous HIV/AIDS-themed documentary film "No Sad Songs".

The film was one of two selected for the Société générale du cinéma du Québec's annual awards, alongside André Melançon's "The Dog Who Stopped the War (La Guerre des tuques)". The award's prize consisted of a $, investment in the production of the directors' next films.

The film received a Genie Award nomination for Best Original Song, for Michel Rivard's "Le temps nous dépasse".
