Viscount of Atouguia

Viscount of Atouguia () was a title created by Queen Maria II of Portugal (on 15 March 1853), to the benefit of Ant√≥nio Aloisio Jervis de Atouguia a political source Madeira. Atouguia da Baleia is a parish in the municipality of Peniche, in Portugal.

After the establishment of the First Portuguese Republic in 1910, with the fall of the monarchy, titleholders became pretenders, including Rui Gomes Sequeira Manso Palma Jervis Atouguia Ferreira Pinto Basto (nephew of the predecessor) and Manuel Pepulim Jervis Atouguia.

The honour of Atouguia was re-created by the Duke of Braganza in 2013. The title of Viscount of Atouguia was conferred by the Duke of Braganza to a direct descendant of Philippa of Lancaster, whose son, Ferdinand, was the Lord of Atouguia. The current holder lives with his family in Delaware, United States but prefers to remain private.
