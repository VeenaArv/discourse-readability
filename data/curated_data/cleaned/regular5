Malaiyoor Mambattiyan

Malaiyoor Mambattiyan (literally, Man with shovel from Malaiyoor) is a 1983 Tamil-language Indian vigilante film directed by Rajasekhar, starring Thiagarajan, Saritha and Silk Smita. The film became a blockbuster and established Thigarajan as a star.

The film was remade in Hindi by Rajasekhar himself as "Gangvaa" with Rajinikanth and Shabana Azmi in the lead. Later in 2011, Thiagarajan remade this film with his son Prashanth, titled as "Mambattiyan".

There is a group of youngsters in the village headed by Mambattiyan, who lead life in a forest by robbing the rich and distributing the wealth to the poor; thus Mambattiyan becomes the local Robin Hood.

Thiagarajan was inspired to make a film on the bandit after he got to hear folk song praising the man for helping the village and hailed as "true Robin Hood".
The music was composed by Ilaiyaraaja. The songs "Chinnai Ponnu Selai" and "Kaattu Vazhi" were well received and was later reused in its 2011 remake.
