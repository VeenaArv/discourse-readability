Tropical Storm Arthur was the first tropical storm of the  Atlantic hurricane season. Arthur reached its highest winds of  miles per hour on July . Arthur started on July  near North Carolina, Tropical Storm Arthur moved mostly northwest and Tropical Storm Arthur died on July . The remains caused bad weather in Newfoundland and killed one person.

On July  a low-level circulation started. It moved very slowly northwest and did not become a tropical depression. The low-level circulation moved ashore in Florida. Early on July  the low entered the Atlantic Ocean. Clouds around the low started growing. Late on July  the low became Tropical Depression One, while it was  miles south of Hatteras, North Carolina. On the morning of July  it became a tropical storm and was called "Arthur". Arthur slowly got stronger until July  when it reached its highest winds, which were at  miles per hour. Wind shear caused Arthur to die shortly later. The extratropical low was last seen on July  while it was near Greenland.
