Ron Donagi

Ron Yehuda Donagi (born March , ) is an American mathematician, working in algebraic geometry and string theory.

Donagi received a Ph.D. in  under the supervision of Phillip Griffiths from Harvard University ("On the geometry of Grassmannians"). Currently, he is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania.

From  to , from  to  and in  he was at the Institute for Advanced Study, where he worked with Edward Witten. In the s Donagi applied algebraic geometry to string theory and related theories such as supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories in order to develop models for heterotic string theory from suitable compactifications. Among his achievements in classical algebraic geometry are his work on the Schottky problem and generalizing the Torelli theorem.

He is a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.
