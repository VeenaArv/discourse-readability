Little Anthony and the Imperials

Little Anthony and the Imperials were an African-American vocal group of the 1950s and 1960s. Their lead singer was "Little Anthony" Gourdine. They began as a group, but changed styles as musical trends changed.

Their hit records included "Tears On My Pillow", "Shimmy, Shimmy, Ko-Ko Bop", "I'm On The Outside (Looking In)", "Goin' Out Of My Head", and "Hurt So Bad". Teddy Randazzo was producer and co-songwriter of several of their hits.

The group faded from popularity during the late 1960s, but continued to record until 1975. Little Anthony still performed the group's old hits for many years, at concerts.
