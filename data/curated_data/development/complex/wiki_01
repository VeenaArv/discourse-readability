La minorenne

La minorenne (The minor) is a 1974 Italian commedia sexy all'italiana directed by Silvio Amadio. The author Adriano Tentori referred to the film as "a piece of 1970s fashion history, where the sexy body of Gloria Guida performs masterfully".

A young woman walking along a country road is menaced, then attacked by circling motorcyclists. A well-groomed man in a trench coat watches.

Later, she is in the care of some nuns at what appears to be a girls' school, where we find out her name is Valeria. She receives a medical examination, during which her vision blurs. She likes the young doctor, and they kiss. While they are kissing, the other schoolgirls burst into the room. They subdue the doctor, much to her amusement, and tear his clothes off. They do something apparently very painful to him using a pair of forceps. The same well-groomed, trenchcoated gentleman reappears. It may have all been a daydream.

Later, the girls give a young nun a hard time by being unruly in the woods. The young nun chases Valeria, who takes pity on her when she collapses under a tree to catch her breath. They sit together and talk, but are reprimanded by an older nun, who seems to have rounded up the other girls. The young nun is dismissed and the older nun scolds the young woman, who proceeds to lean against a tree and daydream about a bishop and some nuns who tie her to a St. Andrew's cross and lash her with a whip. She is rescued by the young nun, who seizes the whip and chases away the others, and then she is joined by the schoolgirls, all wearing corsets. The daydream is apparently interrupted when the trenchcoated man inevitably reappears.

After a graduation ceremony, she travels to the villa of her well-to-do father. Fitting back into family life, she meets a beachcomber artist, a pair of wacky priests, and a cast of other local characters, and is caught up in their various intrigues, many of which manage to result in various states of undress. At the end, she is seemingly reconciled with the pleasures of nature and with casual country living.

Ware Mounds and Village Site

The Ware Mounds and Village Site, located west of Ware, Illinois, is an archaeological site comprising three mounds and a village site. The site was inhabited by the Late Woodland and Mississippian cultures from c. 800 to c. 1300. The village is one of the only Mississippian villages known to have existed in the Mississippi River valley in Southern Illinois. As the village was located near two major sources of chert, which Mississippian cultures used to make agricultural tools, it was likely a trading center for the mineral.

The first of the site's three mounds is in diameter. The graves of indigenous peoples have been found in this mound, which was later used as a cemetery by European settlers. The second mound is in diameter, while the third is long and wide. A fourth mound, which was smaller than the other three, was originally located at the site but was demolished by the construction of Illinois Route 3.

The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 18, 1977.

"Thirty" includes ten covers along with two originals, "My All" and "I'll Be the One".

Callea said of the album:

"A lot of these songs I've sung in a live environment, but I've never actually recorded. I wanted to have the opportunity to record them, call the album 'Thirty' and then put a couple of originals on it too. The new songs have been sitting in my iTunes folder for years and I've just been waiting for the right time to have them part of a body of work that I'm really proud of". Callea said that each song on this album has a special significance to him, "These are songs that mean something to me, whether it's melodically or the lyrics behind it or the artist singing it." 

On 25 April 2013, Callea released a video for his song "My All" which features Tim Campbell. On 2 May 2013, Callea performed "My All" live on "Sunrise".

Throughout May, Callea toured Westfield shopping centres in Knox, Liverpool, Castle Hill, Brisbane and Marion to promote the album.

Headbanger (Babymetal song)

Unlike previous tracks released by the band, which had her vocal recorded in segments within the songs, Nakamoto had her lines recorded in a single take several times. She had been told to sing and find a story within the music. By the time she had comprehended the story behind the lyrics, she grew capable of singing the entire song naturally. When Mizuno and Kikuchi listened to her shouting "Headbangeeeeerrrrr!!!!!" for the first time, they felt as if they had seen another cool side of her, surprised by the vocal power. Additionally, the single introduced the members to the whispering style of singing, with the A-side's "Kiero!" (Disappear!) and the B-side's "Uki Uki Midnight". Kobametal was inspired to use it to contrast traditional death growls.

"Headbangeeeeerrrrr!!!!!" was announced as a single on April 27, 2012, with a release date set for July 7, 2012. The single was released in two versions: a standard edition, available via CD and digital formats, and a physical limited "Hedo-ban" ("Head edition"), which contains a CD and a "neck corset" (actually a cervical collar) for headbanging training. Both editions of the single feature the songs "Headbangeeeeerrrrr!!!!!" and , along with instrumental versions (labeled as "Air Vocal ver."). The standard version contains an enhanced CD with a bonus music video of "Babymetal Death", which can only be played on a computer. The artwork of the standard edition depicts a lyric in the song, specifically when the girl is headbanging with the corset, with the crimson-colored moon in the background, as well as the band name appearing at the top. The limited edition artwork depicts a temple scripture of the "Corset of Legend" with the song title spelled out in the middle.

Before the physical international release of the song, its title was written ambiguously as either "Head Bangya!!" or "Headbangeeeeerrrrr!!!!!", the latter of which is officially used in the international re-release of "Babymetal" and all future releases. The music video uploaded to the band's YouTube channel initially had the former name, though it was switched to the latter in 2015; the version uploaded by Toy's Factory consistently retained the official title.

With music written and arranged by Coaltar of the Deepers member Narasaki, "Headbangeeeeerrrrr!!!!!" contains lyrics revolving around a girl on her fifteenth birthday, along with melancholy vocals, a backing track incorporating screams and double bass drums, finishing with an intense, emo-style melody. According to Nakamoto, the lyrics of the song did not initially have significance to her. After listener of the song explained how they had bought "jū-hachi kippu" tickets to see a concert far from home as stated in the song, she started to understand more of the theme.

The B-side, "Uki Uki ★ Midnight", has been described by "Barks" as a sequel to the song "Doki Doki ☆ Morning". Arranged by Yuyoyuppe, the song contains elements of metalcore and dubstep, along with segments of pop melodies and death growls. Notably, the bridge contains elements of the English lullaby "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star". Nakamoto described the lyrics, along with those of "Doki Doki ☆ Morning" as two parts of one peaceful day in the life of a teenage girl, although a connection was not discovered at first.

Kazumi Nanba of "Rolling Stone Japan" said that the group gained popularity by relying much on its gimmicks, commenting on the song's combination of the "Vwoh!" death growls and the "cute chanting shouts".

Directed by , who would be named Best Director of that year (2012) at the Space Shower Music Video Awards, the music video was first released to the Toy's Factory YouTube channel on June 20, 2012. It narrated a story of a 15-year-old girl who found a legendary neck corset in a mysterious box that fell upon her from above. The box is visually similar to the cover of the limited edition of the single. All of a sudden, the corset jumps out of her hands, wraps around her neck and turns her into "Headbangeeeeerrrrr!!!!!". According to Mizuno, the members of the band wore their heaviest makeup for the "Headbangeeeeerrrrr!!!!!" music video, while Kikuchi felt the fake eyelashes used were pulling down on her eyelids.

A video was not released for "Uki Uki ★ Midnight" with the availability of the single, though Kikuchi initially desired one, with a scene of eating squid arms, analogous to the line "Squid arms, squid arms, I want to eat squid arms". In 2013, a music video was released as part of a bonus DVD for the limited "Z" edition of the single Ijime, Dame, Zettai. The video features the live performance of the song from Legend: Corset Festival on July 21, 2012, interspersed with behind-the-scenes footage of the band members and close-ups of the three members singing the lines of the song.

During the live performances at Akasaka Blitz on December 20, 2012, and at Makuhari Messe on December 21, 2012, a remix titled "Night of 15 mix." was performed, containing more elements of electronic music. The former took place on Suzuka Nakamoto's actual fifteenth birthday, while the latter was the opening song for the concert. Remixed by DJ'Tekina//Something, the song was later released as part of Social Reform promotional editions of the single "Ijime, Dame, Zettai", and later appeared on DJ'Tekina//Something's remix album "Kawa-EDM" (2016), re-subtitled as "Tekina Remix".

"Headbangeeeeerrrrr!!!!!" was first performed at the Pop'n Idol 02 venue at Zepp Tokyo on June 23, 2012. To promote the release of the single, the band performed the song during their promotional event at Tower Records/Tsuyata stores, first at Namba Rockets, Osaka on July 7, and at ell.Size, Nagoya on July 8. On July 14, the band performed in the concert Uki Uki ☆ Afternoon at Tower Records, Shibuya as a part of the Tower Records event "No Music, No Idol?". The band also played the concert Legend: Corset Festival at Meguro Rock May Kan on July 21, 2012, where the song "Uki Uki ★ Midnight" was first performed live, and fans accepted into the concert were required to wear the corsets.

Yui Mizuno and Moa Kikuchi also performed some of the lead parts of “Headbangeeeeerrrrr!!!!!” for their fifteenth birthdays, although not on the exact days; Mizuno's performance was on July 1, 2014 at La Cigale in Paris and Kikuchi's was on July 3, 2014 at the Live Music Hall in Cologne, respectively, during the Babymetal World Tour 2014. In both instances, Su-metal ceremoniously handed over her microphone during the breakdown after the first chorus and then took over the singer's position in the choreography. In the show at the Hiroshima Green Arena, which took place in the month of Nakamoto's twentieth birthday, most references to were replaced with .

Unlike in contemporary heavy metal performances, the members of the band dance to "Headbangeeeeerrrrr!!!!!" with a variation of headbanging called "baby headbanging", where the three lightly jump while swing their heads from shoulder to shoulder. A second variation known as "dogeza headbanging" involves kneeling and bowing deeply. Su-metal considered the unison of choreography for "Uki Uki ★ Midnight" to be difficult and strange, with elements of monster-like movements, falling asleep in the real world, and once more in a dream world.

Blue Jeans (1975 film)

Blue Jeans is a 1975 Italian erotic-drama film directed by Mario Imperoli. The film grossed about 310 million lire at the Italian box office. The film critic Vittorio Spiga referred to the film as "an adult comic book that flows into a real exaltation of the remarkable ass of Gloria Guida".

Daniela (Guida), nicknamed "Blue Jeans" after her cut-off jean shorts, is an underage streetwalker. She is caught by the police and claims that she is the illegitimate daughter of Dr. Carlo Anselmi (Paolo Carlini), a renowned restoration artist living in Latina countryside. Although Anselmi claims the opposite, Daniela's word is taken as a presumption of law and she is entrusted to Anselmi. While the frivolous behaviour of the young prostitute causes havoc with Anselmi's girlfriend Marisa (Annie Carol Edel), things get further complicated when Daniela starts to implement a plot with her pimp Sergio (Gianluigi Chirizzi).

Institute for Applied Theatre Studies

The Institute for Applied Theatre Studies (Angewandte Theaterwissenschaft, ATW) is part of the Justus Liebig University Gießen. It offers three different degree programs: a three-year Bachelor‘s program, Applied Theatre Studies, and two two-year Master’s programs, Applied Theatre Studies and Choreography and Performance (CuP). Each course places equal importance on academic and artistic practice. In seminars, reading courses and tutorials, students asked to engage with theoretical issues, while in performance projects, practical courses and workshops they experiment with different artistic approaches. Courses in the humanities and cultural studies offered by the university are also incorporated into each program. In choreography and performance, certain practical classes are organized in cooperation with the Frankfurt University of Music and Performing Arts (Hochschule für Musik und darstellende Kunst, Frankfurt am Main), where these classes will also be held.

Established in 1982, the Institute for Applied Theatre Studies became the first University program that integrated a study of artistic practice into the study of theatre. Under the leadership of Andrzej Wirth and his collaborator Hans-Thies Lehmann, the institute quickly developed into an alternative to those established theatre schools that understood theatre exclusively as acting based on dramas and prepared their students for a market dominated by the well-established municipal theatres. In addition, the institute stood in opposition to other academic departments for theatre studies, where there was little interest in practice. There, the discipline was understood primarily as theatre historiography.

Wirth and a variety of guest professors including Heiner Müller, George Tabori, Emma Lewis Thomas and Robert Wilson sought out new forms of theatre, that challenged the orthodoxies of the German-speaking theatre scene in terms of its understanding of theatre. Influenced by Wirth and his choice of guest professors, some of the early works by students dealt with the tradition of Brecht’s „Lehrstücken“ and minimalist tendencies springing from the fine arts. Simultaneously, Lehmann worked on the theory of these new approaches to theatre, that could not be conceived within the theory of performance and acting that was dominant at the time. Due to Lehmann’s influential work, these forms of theatre are today known as postdramatic theatre.

In the 1990s, the theatre studies scholar Helga Finter and the composer and director Heiner Goebbels took over the scientific and artistic leadership of the institute. Goebbels extended the scope of the artistic teachings to include more contemporary media-related forms of presentation and productions that would come to include music, sound and light. Further, with the completion of sound and video studios, a platform for independent work with these new media forms was established. Academically, Finter developed new areas of study by delving into the theatricality of the literary and theatrical experiments of the historical avant-garde, in particular those of Antonin Artaud. The works of Wilson and other contemporary directors and artists such as Klaus Michael Grüber were among Finter’s objects of study, and led Finter to a theory of theatre that described it as a place of negotiation for subjectivity that contrasted a continuously solidifying society of spectacle. The tradition of guest professors continues to this day and continues to exert an important influence on the institute. Participating artists and scholars invoted have included John Jesurun, Eugenio Barba, Herbert Blau, Richard Foreman, Marina Abramović, Richard Schechner, Patrice Pavis, Josette Feral, Samuel Weber, Georg Seeßlen, Mathilde Monnier, Jérôme Bel, Xavier Le Roy, Rabih Mroué, Tino Sehgal and Claudia Bosse.

In 2008 the MA Choreography and Performance and a professorship for dance studies with a focal point on choreography and performance were established. Already in the 1990s, during Gabrielle Brandstetter’s stay at the institute, a strong focus on contemporary forms of dance had been instigated. Setting up this new MA program then represented a further opening of the institute towards contemporary dance and choreography. This program is organized in cooperation with the department for contemporary dance at the Frankfurt University of Music and Performing Arts. In the early years of the program, it was supervised by Gerald Siegmund. Similar to the already existing Bachelor and Master program Applied Theatre Studies, the MA Choreography and Performance offers both an academic and artistic approach, though with a particular focus on the body, its movement, its politics and economics.

Today there are four chairs at the Institute for Applied Theatre Studies, three of which are held permanently. Currently, Heiner Goebbels holds the chair in artistic practice, Gerald Siegmund holds the chair in theatre studies and has been managing director of the Institute since 2011. Bojana Kunst has held the chair in dance studies since 2012. The fourth chair is designed for the guest professorhips and is thus held by different artists over the course of a year. Whereas in the 1980s and 1990s, the conventional definitions and practices of theatre necessitated more innovative forms of teaching and understanding of theatre. Today the decline of the artistic importance of the municipal theatres and the enormous changes in the theatre landscape have brought other discussions to the fore: the ambivalences in the independent theatre scenes, its internationalisation and its working conditions due to the intensification of economic pressures produce new challenges and problems for the production but also for the aesthetics of contemporary theatre. 

The Institute for Applied Theatre Studies thrives on a proactive student body. For many years, students have independently organized a number of festivals: the Theatermaschine, a platform for the presentation of students‘ own works; the Diskurs festival, first founded in 1982, a noted international festival for the performing arts. For this festival, artists are invited with their works to participate in discourse and discussion; and finally the relatively young Instant-festival, which seeks to further the exchange with a program called The Scenic Arts at the University Hildesheim. This festival is hosted alternately in Gießen and Hildesheim. All festivals, but also the presentation of performance projects and practical courses, include critical discussions. These allow for an exchange between the students over their own practice and that characterizes the institute’s culture of discussion.

Alumni of the Institute for Applied Theatre Studies work in diverse fields of dance, theatre and performance, fine arts, media and academia. For more than 30 years, graduates continue to leave a lasting impression, both in the municipal theatre scene, the independent theatre scene and even in the academic world. Réne Pollesch, Gob Squad, She She Pop, Rimini Protokoll, Showcase Beat Le Mot, Otmar Wagner, Thomas Martius, Jürgen Fritz, Monster Truck, Auftrag : Lorey and many more have had a lasting impact on the theatre scene with their non-hierarchical and collective methods and unique aesthetics. Miriam Dreysse, Jens Roselt, Annemarie Matzke, André Eiermann and Jörn Etzold work in theatre departments across the German-speaking world, Frank Hentschker and Markus Wessendorf at American universities, all formulating new analytical approaches and theories of contemporary theatre.

Bogey value

In manufacturers' specifications for electronic devices, a bogey device (or bogie device) - especially a vacuum tube- is one that has all characteristics equal to the published values, in other words that its parameters all lie in the centre of their bell curve distributions.

A bogey is a published value for a parameter of an electronic component, such as a vacuum tube, that is average or typical of devices that will be sold, and which the device's manufacturer is attempting to achieve. With manufacturing tolerances and variables in production, most devices produced do not exactly meet the bogey value for each parameter.

Apart from a bogey device being a "theoretical" device that has the given characteristics, the term can refer to a specially-selected example of a device (e.g. from a production run where care is taken to ensure each characteristic has its nominal value); for example a bogey tube could be used to calibrate tube testers and be expected to give readings in the middle of the meter's "good" region. Hence a tube can be specified by its bogey values and suitable tolerances, and tests are based on the bogey values. For applications such as music amplifiers where the channels need to have nearly identical performance, it is desirable that components are matched and have major parameter values close to bogey.

Buhûrizâde Abdülkerim Efendi

Among the multitudes of Turkish musicians, Buhûrizâde is still known as one of the greatest. Very little is known about the intimate details of his early life, other than that he spent almost all of it in Constantinople. As a teenager, he entered the Kocamustafapaşa tekke of the Sünbüliyye Sufi order, which was led, at the time, by Nûreddin Efendi. After a period of training and study under his superiors, he was eventually appointed "zâkirbaşı", or prayer-leader, of the tekke. He later became the leader of the Şah Sultan Sünbüliyye tekke in Eyüp, a position he held well into his eighties, when he died.

Buhûrizâde, in his compositional work, be it poetry or music, wrote under the name "Kemter", which is a typically Sufi pseudonym meaning poor, or pitiful. Judging from his own journals and those of others in his tekkes, it is clear that Buhûrizâde was a highly respected poet and composer. As a result of this, he has come to be known as one of the most important composers of religious music in the mid to late 18th century in the Ottoman Empire. Sadly, and for reasons no one quite knows, only five complete composition of Buhûrizâde have survived to the present day, so while we may marvel at the skill that he has left with us, the rest of his vast repertoire can only be experienced through the contemporary writings of others who heard and experienced it themselves.

Lollo however, after the death of his uncle becomes the only remaining heir of the Mascalucia family, and therefore resumes the idea of becoming a father. So, following an agreement with his wife, he finds a girl who already has a child, and is willing to give him an heir. However, there is no sign of a child, even with the young girl. It's clear now that in fact Lollo is the one who is sterile and not his wife. So instead Rosalia will at last give him the longed-for son and heir, using a "substitute" for her husband.

From the founding of the National Health Service in 1948 until the reorganisation in 1974 the hospital management committee was the main instrument of local management. There were originally 377 committees which were answerable to the 14 regional hospital boards. The 36 teaching hospitals were outside this structure and reported directly to the Minister for Health.

Hospital management committees predated the NHS as many institutions were transferred to local councils under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1929 by which Boards of Guardians were abolished.

Aneurin Bevan, who introduced the National Health Service in 1948, was a member of the Tredegar Cottage Hospital Management Committee around 1928 and was chairman in 1929/30.

Sam Dekker

Samuel Thomas Dekker (born May 6, 1994) is an American professional basketball player for Lokomotiv Kuban of the VTB United League and the EuroCup. Dekker attended Sheboygan Lutheran High School in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. He played college basketball for the Wisconsin Badgers. After finishing college on a championship game run in the 2015 NCAA Tournament, Dekker was a very highly rated NBA draft prospect and was selected by the Houston Rockets with the 18th overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft.

Dekker was named the Wisconsin Gatorade Player of the Year following his senior season. He was also named 2012 "Parade" All-American, AP first-team all-state and Wisconsin Basketball Coaches' Association's Mr. Basketball award. He led Sheboygan Lutheran to the school's first-ever WIAA state title. Dekker scored 40 points, including the last 12, in the state title game including the game-winning three-point shot after dribbling the length of the court with two seconds left.

Dekker played in 35 games (3 starts) as a freshman on the Wisconsin Badgers. He is one of only four true freshman to start under Bo Ryan joining Devin Harris, Alando Tucker and Josh Gasser. He earned Big Ten All-Freshman team recognition as well as honorable mention All-Big Ten honors. He was also two-time Big Ten Freshman of the Week (January 14 and March 4, 2013). Dekker scored a season-high 19 points against Arkansas on November 24, 2012, and Nebraska on February 26, 2013.

Before the season, Dekker was named to the Wooden Award and Naismith Trophy watch lists.

At the conclusion of the regular season, Dekker was named to the Second Team All-Big Ten by the coaches and Third Team All-Big Ten by the media.

Before the season, Dekker was named to the Wooden Award and Naismith Trophy watch lists.
At the conclusion of the regular season, Dekker was named to the Second Team All-Big Ten by the coaches and by the media. But he really only took off in the NCAA Tournament. In the Sweet 16 against the number four seeded North Carolina Tar Heels, Dekker scored a career high 23 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead the 1-seed Wisconsin to a 79-72 victory. In the Elite 8 against the number 2-seeded Arizona Wildcats, Dekker again came up big, scoring a new career high 27 points, including 5 of the Badgers's 10 second-half threes, the final of which is now known nationally as the "Dekker Dagger" shot because it sealed the win for Wisconsin. For these efforts, he was named West Regional Most Outstanding Player during the 2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. In the Final Four game against the heavily favored and undefeated Kentucky Wildcats, Dekker came through with another huge game, scoring 16 points, including the three that gave Wisconsin the lead for good. The Badgers finished second in the NCAA tournament after losing to Duke in the championship game. A week later, Dekker declared for the 2015 NBA draft, forgoing his final year of college eligibility.

On June 25, 2015, Dekker was selected by the Houston Rockets with the 18th overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft. On July 7, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Rockets but subsequently missed the entire 2015 NBA Summer League due to a back injury. He appeared in all eight of the Rockets' preseason games, but managed game time in just three of the team's first 11 regular-season games. On November 18, 2015, he was ruled out for three months after requiring back surgery. On February 19, 2016, he was assigned to the Rio Grande Valley Vipers, the Rockets' D-League affiliate, on a rehab assignment. He was recalled by the Rockets on February 22. He went on to receive two more assignments to the Vipers.

On December 14, 2016, Dekker scored a career-high 19 points in a 132–98 win over the Sacramento Kings. On January 21, 2017, he made his first career start and set a new career high with 30 points in a 119–95 win over the Memphis Grizzlies.

On June 28, 2017, the Los Angeles Clippers acquired Dekker, Patrick Beverley, Montrezl Harrell, Darrun Hilliard, DeAndre Liggins, Lou Williams, Kyle Wiltjer and a 2018 first-round pick from the Houston Rockets in exchange for Chris Paul.

On August 7, 2018, Dekker was traded, along with the draft rights to Renaldas Seibutis and cash considerations, to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for the draft rights to Vladimir Veremeenko.

Shanghai Manhua

Shanghai Manhua (), originally titled Shanghai Sketch, was a weekly pictorial magazine published in Shanghai from 21 April 1928 until 7 June 1930. Considered the first successful manhua magazine in China and one of the most influential, it was highly popular and inspired numerous imitators in Shanghai and the rest of China. "Shanghai Manhua" was known for its provocative cover art and the popular "Mr. Wang" comic strip by Ye Qianyu.

Among the artists who established "Shanghai Manhua", several had worked together on the small, short-lived journal "Sanri Huabao" ("Three Day Pictorial"), including Ye Qianyu and the brothers Zhang Guangyu and Zhang Zhenyu. The journal was shut down when Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition reached Shanghai in April 1927.

Out of work, cartoonists Ye Qianyu, Huang Wennong, and Lu Shaofei published a dedicated publication for manhua named "Shanghai Manhua" ("Shanghai Sketch"). The first effort resembled a propaganda poster and was a failure. Undeterred, the original three, joined by eight more artists, including the Zhang brothers, Ding Song, and Wang Dunqing, formed the "Shanghai Sketch Society" (also translated as "Shanghai Manhua Society") in the autumn of 1927. It was China's first association dedicated to manhua and a major event in the history of Chinese comics.

Although the society had no formal structure, the two eldest and most established artists, Zhang Guangyu and Ding Song, were regarded as its leaders. The society was registered and often met at Ding Song's home on Rue Amiral Bayle (now South Huangpi Road).

Under the leadership of Zhang Guangyu, who recruited sponsors including the wealthy poet Shao Xunmei, the association relaunched "Shanghai Manhua" on 21 April 1928. It proved very popular: about three thousand copies of each issue were printed, which was considered a large amount for the 1920s.

In 1930, a Singapore-based businessman made a proposal to Zhang Guangyu and Zhang Zhenyu for starting a new pictorial magazine to compete with the popular monthly "The Young Companion" ("Liangyou"). The Zhang brothers agreed, but several partners in charge of photography objected. As a result of the dispute, "Shanghai Manhua" was shut down in June 1930 after publishing 110 issues. The manhua team of the magazine moved with the Zhangs to the newly established Shidai (Epoch) Publishing Group, which went on to publish a series of magazines including "Modern Sketch", the centerpiece of China's golden era of cartoon art.

In May 1936 Zhang Guangyu re-established "Shanghai Manhua", while many of the original members were then working with "Modern Sketch". Together they organized the highly successful First National Cartoon Exhibition in September and formed the National Association of Chinese Cartoonists in the spring of 1937. The blossoming movement, however, was brought to a halt by the Japanese invasion a few months later.

Each issue of the magazine consists of eight pages including the front and back covers. The front cover featured its famously provocative cover art, and the back page carried Ye Qianyu's popular comic strip "Mr. Wang", inspired by the American "Bringing Up Father". Reflecting the tribulations of daily urban life, "Mr. Wang" became one of China's most famous cartoons. Pages four and five were dedicated to other cartoons from various artists, and the remaining four pages were flexibly given to manhua, photography, prose, reviews, etc.

In addition to members of the Shanghai Sketch Society, other famous artists and writers also contributed to "Shanghai Manhua", including Shao Xunmei (Sinmay Zau), a wealthy and influential poet, writer, and publisher. His friend, artist and writer Ye Lingfeng, also became a staff member and regular contributor. Their photographs were frequently published in the magazine, with some taken by the famous photographer Lang Jingshan.

Many of the images published in "Shanghai Manhua" reflect the daily urban life, while others are innovative visual commentaries on political events and contemporary society. The editorial staff of the magazine had close links to leading members of the decadent "neo-sensationist" school of the Shanghai literary scene. Influenced by ideas expressed in their writing, the artists produced startling images unparalleled in Republican-era China.

Aleksandar Tomov (politician)

Aleksandar Trifonov Tomov () (born 27 April 1954) is a Bulgarian politician, economist, and academic.

In the 1970s, Tomov was a student at the UNWE and Leningrad University. He completed his primary, secondary and university education with excellent marks. In 1984, Tomov earned a doctoral degree in the field of economics. Tomov has made specializations in political science and macroeconomics in Sofia and London.

In addition to his political career, Tomov has also worked as a professor and lecturer in the political science department (of which he is one of the founders in 1985) at Sofia University. He has further taught courses at the Karl Marx Institute of Economics in Sofia. Tomov has authored six books. In 1995, Tomov was appointed as the director of the EastWest Institute in New York City for a period of three years.

In 1990, Tomov was elected to the 7th Grand National Assembly of Bulgaria as a member of the Bulgarian Socialist Party. He was also a member of the 36th and 38th National Parliaments. Tomov served as Deputy-Prime Minister in the Dimitar Popov government, the first one since the collapse of the communist system in 1989.

In 1993, he established the Citizens' Union for the Republic (Bulgarian: Гражданско обединение за републиката), which was initially not envisioned as a political party. However, it evolved into the Bulgarian Euro-Left in 1997.

Tomov was formerly vice-chairman of the supreme council (Bulgarian: Висш съвет) of the Bulgarian Socialist Party and was among the founders of the Bulgarian Euro-Left in 1997, eventually being elected (and reelected in 2000) as its leader after receiving more votes than his main opponent Elena Poptodorova. The Euro-Left officially became a political party in 1998. He has been critical of the delayed social democratization of the BSP party in the 1990s.

In 1996, Tomov was a candidate to become President of Bulgaria (with Lyudmil Marinchevski as his running mate) and finished in fourth place, earning 3.16% of the votes cast.

Since 2003, Tomov has been the leader of the Bulgarian Social Democracy party. In 2013, his party expressed support for the "Bulgarian Spring" (Bulgarian: Българска пролет) protest movement.

In 2009, Tomov came under legal scrutiny due to supposedly abusing his position during his time as chairman of the managerial board of Kremikovtzi. In early 2011, the Sofia City Court found Tomov guilty of allegedly siphoning off money (15 million leva) from Kremikovtzi, imposing a prison sentence. In 2013, the Appellate Court decided that the case needs a review and returned it to the court of first instance, with the trial recommencing in April 2014. In February 2015, the Sofia City Court declared Tomov not culpable.

Tomov is also well known for his involvement in various capacities with the CSKA Sofia football club. He was instrumental in bringing Indian businessman Pramod Mittal to Bulgaria in relation to a number of Kremikovtzi deals. Mittal eventually became the owner of the "armymen" in December 2006 before selling the club to Titan Sport EAD in early 2009. Tomov served as the president of CSKA Sofia between 5 December 2006 and 5 June 2008 as well as from July 2008 to 9 April 2009.

In the summer of 2008, Tomov was blamed by some sections of the reds' supporters due to the team not receiving a license for European club competitions. In the summer of 2013, he was credited with playing a vital role in preventing the team's likely bankruptcy. Tomov was the main CSKA Sofia shareholder and de facto owner (with Lira Investment providing the main part of the financing) of the club between the second half of 2013 and April 2015. He has been against the idea of a deliberate declaration of insolvency and the creation of a new unofficial successor company as a solution to the debts accumulated by the club.

Tomov has three children named Rada, Lidia and Alexander. His wife Kalina is an expert on psychology. Tomov's sister, Tatyana, is an academic at Sofia University whose area of expertise covers the social policies of European countries. One of Tomov's great-grandfathers perished in the April Uprising.

In addition to his native Bulgarian, he is also conversant in English and Russian. In an interview with the press, Tomov identified drawing as one of his hobbies. Since February 2015, Tomov has a profile on Facebook.

Kim Sin-yong

Kim Sin Yong (The romanization preferred by the author according to LTI Korea or Hangul: 김신용) is a South Korean writer.

Kim Sin Yong was born on April first, 1945 in Busan, Korea. Kim's early life was difficult as he was exposed to poverty, separation and death. His father died when Kim was fourteen and his stepmother, older, brother, and sister abandoned him. With his three half-sisters, Kim was forced onto the streets. In his work "Cast-Away Lives" (1988), he describes his hand-to-mouth existence as an A-frame carrier, bicycle car driver, movie extra, and worker in a town being demolished for urban renewal. He also sold his blood for money, and engaged in petty thievery, which resulted in his working as a laborer in a prison gang. Imprisonment, at age 16, came to Kim as a relief from the hardships of the outside world, as in prison he was fed, clothed, and allowed to read. In fact, Kim called prison “my classroom, my workroom.”

Kim's poems record what life is like at the bottom of the social heap. But his poems contain nothing of the all- consuming rage at society or hostile enmity that one might expect from a poet with his background. Kim does not place blame for his life on capitalist society, its oppression of workers, or the contradictions in the social structure. His labor poetry does not possess an organizational or ideological character. Instead, it casts a sympathetic gaze on the difficult lives of those who have dropped to the lowest place in society, and embraces them warmly. These labor poems have little in common with antagonistic strikers on the picket line. Rather, they exist as small voices offering up consolation in whispered tones that reflect the experiences of the workers themselves. Even though his poetic subjects live in a world of poverty, neglect and lack of compassion, the poems hold out hope that love—in the truest sense of the word—can help these individuals form a community that belongs to them alone. As one critic summarized his work, he "continues to feel imaginary pains even after the disappearance of a painful life but endures them with aesthetic sorrow."

Kim won three literary awards in his career, the Cheon Sang-byeong Poetry Prize in 2005, and the Sowol Prize of Excellence and Long-Term Literature Prize (노작문학상) in 2006.

Babymetal / Kiba of Akiba

Babymetal and Kiba of Akiba first met under the management of the main group Sakura Gakuin, and later, decided on a collaboration. The split single was announced on February 9, 2012 for release on March 7, 2012, and was the fifth overall single released to promote "Sakura Gakuin 2011 Nendo: Friends".

The single contains two original songs, one performed by Babymetal and one by Kiba of Akiba, and two bonus tracks. The first bonus track, "Kimi to Anime Ga Mitai – Answer for Animation with You" is a cover of the Kiba of Akiba song "Animation with You", as performed by Babymetal. The second bonus track is a remix of the Babymetal song "Doki Doki ☆ Morning", as performed by Kiba of Akiba. The single artwork depicts a fox who has grown fangs (the former is motif for Babymetal, while the latter is a motif for Kiba of Akiba) holding up a kitsune sign with Akihabara in the background.

On April 6, 2012, Babymetal performed at Tower Records Japan in Shibuya to commemorate the release of the single.

 was first released as the band's second song as a subgroup of Sakura Gakuin, and the fifth single overall from the album "Sakura Gakuin 2011 Nendo: Friends", from which an remix of the song, "Iine!" (Vega Mix ver.), was featured. The song was first teased in the video "Babymetal: My First Heavy Metal in Tokyo 2012" uploaded to YouTube on February 1, 2012, along with a short demo of "Ijime, Dame, Zettai".

The band premiered the song at the concert “Woman's Power 20th Anniversary” at Shibuya O-West on January 9, 2012. "Iine!" later served as the second single for their debut album "Babymetal".

According to Blabbermouth.net, "Iine!" "combines pop with extreme metal guitars, an occasional growl or two and a tinge of hip hop". Brad Nelson of "The Guardian" compared the breakdown in "Iine!" to the works of Lex Luger, "down to the nervy, rattling snares". Japanese music portal "Barks" described the song with an edgy sound in the beginning as the electronica/screamo style, electronicore (known in Japan as "pikorimo"). The breakdown contains elements of hip hop, then a combination of death metal sounds and screamo. The screams, "It's not the sign of the horns, it's a kitsune sign" refer to the three members initially mistaking the former for the head of a fox.

Suzuka Nakamoto stated that the song expressed the band's desire to establish a fun, aggressive, new genre in music, and challenged them to rap. She has also stated: "I have an impression that many American fans are fond of dance music tunes like "Iine!" Overall, the response from American audiences during our shows is so real." She further explained that the choreography at the chorus is easy, allowing the audience to build hype with the band, with sudden shouts just before the climax.

The music video for "Iine!", directed by Daishinszk, was uploaded in part to the Toy's Factory YouTube channel on February 24, 2012, while the full video was uploaded to the official Babymetal channel on November 8, 2012. The video features a variation of para-para style dance in the interlude, along with several scenes of the members in hip hop style costumes.

 is an "otailish" (stylish otaku) death pop band from Kyoto, whose musical style combined screamo with otaku culture. The song "Party @the BBS" has been called a classic live song. Following the limited release of "Animation With You", "Party @the BBS" served as the second single from the album "Yeniol". The song, which has interpreted to be a love song, contains an internet motif of "Let's party at the bulletin board system" played in a heavy tune, with lyrics such as "We have been waiting here, for you" sung in a melancholy manner. A live performance of the song was uploaded to YouTube on May 1, 2012.

The song is a cover of the Kiba of Akiba song "Animation With You", released in 2011. The lyrics have been changed as to represent a girl's point of view. Nakamoto stated that the song was the first time she had heard metal death growls, though the growls were ultimately left to the other two members for the cover. Unlike the original song, the chorus contains background vocals from Mizuno and Kikuchi. The latter called the song one of the band's beloved, thanking Kiba of Akiba for the introduction.

Kiba of Akiba's performance of "Doki Doki ☆ Morning" is described to be not only a cover, but one with added "Kiba style" arrangements. Changes to the original include a higher tempo, synths filling up the space, and varying styles of vocals. When asked of the production of the song, the Kiba of Akiba producers replied "We touched on things the world had never seen before. In fact, our work seemed rather fresh, and everyone in the studio was dying of laughter."

Elton Engstrom Jr.

Elton Egedeous Engstrom Jr. (February 26, 1935 – November 6, 2013) was an American lawyer, businessman, writer, and politician. Engstrom served one term apiece in the Alaska House of Representatives and the Alaska Senate as a Republican during the 1960s, leaving in 1971. He was also a part of one of Alaska's longest-enduring political families; his father served in Alaska's territorial and state senates, his mother served in the territorial house, and his daughter, Cathy Muñoz was a member of the Alaska House from 2011 through January 16, 2017.

Elton Egedeous Engstrom Jr. was born in Juneau, Alaska, the elder of two sons born to Thelma Catherine (née Wait) and Elton Engstrom, Sr. His father moved to Juneau from Wrangell in 1928.

Paralobesia viteana

Paralobesia viteana, the grape berry moth, is a moth of the family Tortricidae, found in Eastern North America and western Colorado, where it is an important agricultural pest in vineyards. The synonym "Endopiza viteana" is frequently used in literature, but was replaced by "Paralobesia viteana" per J.W. Brown (2006).

Newly hatched larvae are about 1 mm long and creamy white or yellow-green in appearance. They turn purple as they mature and grow to a length of roughly 8 mm.

The wingspan of an adult "Paralobesia viteana" specimen ranges from 8 to 13 mm. The forewings are brown with a mild purplish sheen and a band in the middle of the wing, with a wing pattern similar both to other Nearctic species of "Paralobesia" and to "Lobesia botrana", with the latter unable to be separated from "P. viteana" on wing pattern alone. The lighter hindwings, which are more cream-colored, are folded beneath the forewings when in rest. The head and body of "P. viteana" are brown.

"P. viteana" is native to Eastern North America, with wild grape as ancestral host plant. In recent times, it has also been observed in western Colorado. The primary host plant in both areas is grape ("Vitis spp."), both wild and cultivated variations, though documentation of "P. viteana" on other host plants, including sassafras and blackberry, exists. Because of the damage done by the larvae when feeding from the grape berries and blossoms, "P. viteana" is considered to be one of the worst insect pests on grape berries in the Eastern North American bioregion.

Depending on weather and location, "P. viteana" occurs in two to four generations per year, with generations above a second being more common in the southern areas of its range but occasionally happening in the northern areas as well. The last generation overwinters in the pupal stage. Adults of the various generations of "P. viteana" are on wing from roughly March to August, depending on the weather and location.

The adults of the first flight emerge, after overwintering, during spring around the time of grapevine bloom. The females lay the eggs of the first generation separately on flowers or small berries. After about four to eight days the eggs hatch.

The first generation larvae feed on flowers, growing fruit clusters and tender stems from the outside, webbing the developing cluster together. As the caterpillars reach maturity, they leave the cluster to pupate by cutting part of a leaf and wrapping it around themselves to create a cocoon. Occasionally, they pupate within a webbed cluster.

The later generations of larvae do not feed externally, but tunnel into the berries, feeding from within. This causes red spots on the grape berries at the point of entry. Grapes affected in such a way are known as "stung" berries. A single caterpillar may go through two to six berries before pupating. Although early larvae of the first generation may cause serious damage by feeding on the blossoms, buds and developing berries, the later generations often cause the majority of damage to the grape harvest by causing parts of berries to ripen early and hollowing out berries, both reducing yield and increasing the risk of fungal infection and infection by fruit flies.

Larvae of the last generation overwinter in the pupal stage on the ground, in leaf litter.

Farewell Album

Farewell Album is the final album released by The New Seekers in their early 1970s hit-making line up, released in 1974. It is also the group's last release on Polydor Records.

In early 1974, despite being at the peak of their success, both female members Eve Graham and Lyn Paul had expressed their wish to leave the group. This was against the terms of their contract (which allowed for only one member to leave at a time), so came the announcement that the group were to split entirely. They released another single and album (both top 20 hits) before they performed their final shows in May.

They had however recorded a number of songs for Polydor before their disbanding and the label issued these as "Farewell Album" in August 1974 - three months after the group had ended. Two of the twelve tracks had been earlier recordings however. One single was released from the album, called "Sing Hallelujah". The single stalled outside the official top 50 in the UK at No.65, and as the album received no promotion from the group, it similarly failed to chart. "Farewell Album" received a favourable review from "Disc" magazine, commenting on the fact that 10 of the 12 tracks feature female leads, while member Marty Kristian features on lead for just two of the songs.

Timothy Massad

Timothy George Massad (born July 30, 1956) is an American lawyer and government official who served as the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) under President Barack Obama. He had previously been Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability at the United States Department of the Treasury, where he oversaw the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) created by the U.S. government in response to the financial crisis of 2007–08.

Massad earned his undergraduate degree at Harvard University in 1978. After stints working for Ralph Nader and the AFL–CIO, he returned to Harvard to earn a law degree in 1981. He then began a 25-year career as a corporate lawyer at the firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, where he became an expert on corporate finance and derivatives.

Massad briefly joined the staff of TARP's Congressional Oversight Panel before moving to the Office of Financial Stability as chief counsel. In September 2010 he was named acting Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability. The U.S. Senate confirmed him to the position in June 2011. In November 2013, President Barack Obama nominated him to be CFTC chairman. The Senate confirmed him in June 2014.

Massad was born July 30, 1956, in New Orleans, Louisiana. His parents were the children of Lebanese immigrants. His mother, Delores Jean Razook, was a homemaker, and his father, Alexander Hamilton Massad, was an executive in the oil industry, mostly at Mobil. In Timothy's earlier years the family moved often because of his father's career, but in 1968 they settled in Darien, Connecticut, where the parents remained for 18 years. Timothy has a brother and a sister.

Massad graduated from Darien High School in 1974 as a National Merit Scholar and then interned with a Congressman. He then enrolled at Harvard University, earning a bachelor's degree "magna cum laude" in social studies in 1978. After graduation he went to work for Ralph Nader and also worked for the AFL–CIO, a labor movement organization. During this time he was active in the anti-nuclear movement.

Unsatisfied with his employers' grasp of business and economics, Massad enrolled at Harvard Law School in 1981. In 1983 he helped organize a petition against permitting professors to count class participation toward students' grades. He graduated in 1984 and began his 25-year career at the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore that same year.

At Cravath he became a generalist in corporate law with focus on corporate finance and international business. He was mostly based in New York City, but he also worked at Cravath's London office for a year and co-managed the Hong Kong office from 1998 to 2002. In 2007 he headed Cravath's India practice. During his time at Cravath he became an expert on derivatives and securities law, co-writing with other Cravath lawyers the ISDA Master Agreement that governs most derivatives contracts between institutions.

The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 was enacted in October 2008 in response to the ongoing financial crisis. It created the Office of Financial Stability within the Treasury Department to administer the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), a $700-billion bailout fund for the financial industry.

Massad became involved in TARP when he called a friend, Damon Silvers, to congratulate him on being named to the program's Congressional Oversight Panel. During this conversation, Silvers recruited him to join the panel's staff. Massad took a leave of absence from Cravath from December 2008 to February 2009 to be a pro bono legal adviser to the panel.

Later, when Treasury officials were looking for a chief counsel for the Office of Financial Stability, Silvers recommended Massad. Massad left Cravath in May 2009 to take the position. Following the departure of Herbert M. Allison, the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Stability, Massad was named acting Assistant Secretary beginning in September 2010. The U.S. Senate confirmed his appointment as Assistant Secretary in June 2011. In this role he has supervised the gradual wind-down of TARP.

Massad announced in October 2013 that he would resign as Assistant Secretary. The next month, President Barack Obama announced he would nominate Massad to be chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that regulates derivatives. That post became vacant on Jan. 3, 2014, when Gary Gensler stepped down. The Senate confirmed him on June 3, 2014. He was sworn in on June 5.

Massad is a longtime donor to the Democratic National Committee and to Democratic candidates, including John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election and Obama and Hillary Clinton in the 2008 presidential election. He was active in the anti-nuclear movement in the years before he went to law school, organizing with Donald K. Ross a large protest in Washington, D.C., on May 6, 1979, in the wake of the Three Mile Island accident.

During law school Massad worked on Michael Dukakis's successful 1982 campaign for Governor of Massachusetts. During the 1988 presidential election Massad again supported Dukakis, whom he described as his political hero. Massad was a voting delegate at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, where Dukakis was nominated for president, and took a leave of absence from Cravath to serve as Connecticut director of the Dukakis campaign for the general election. Dukakis lost Connecticut, and the election, to George H. W. Bush.

Massad is an accomplished expert cook. In his early years at Cravath he spent his vacations as a volunteer apprentice at the Manhattan restaurant Bouley. He is known at Treasury for running a baking contest among his staff.

Massad has a wife and two children. They live in Washington, D.C.

Oh Taeseok

Oh Taeseok (Hangul: 오태석) is a South Korean playwright and director.

Oh Taesok was born on October 11, 1940, in Seocheon Chungcheongnam-do. Oh was ten years old when the Korean War began and his childhood became difficult. His father, a Korean politician, was kidnapped and Oh, with his grandmother, became a refugee on a road full of refugees where he witnessed countless deaths. Oh received a degree in Philosophy from Yonsei University in 1963 and immediately threw himself into writing and directing.

Oh Taeseok is known as a theater director and playwright who is extremely adept at portraying Korean life and state of mind. Oh's plays have many elements in common with traditional Korean plays. On stage, the characters of his plays do not carry on static, realistic conversations, but rather engage in vibrant song and dance or wear animal masks while dashing about on stage; exaggerated movements and make-up are also frequently used. Despite the loud, raucous atmosphere on stage, Oh's work depicts the darkness of pain and the shadows of death. The story behind this lies in his childhood memories.

Oh made his formal literary debut with his play Wedding Dress (Wedingdeureseu), which was recognized at the 1967 New Years Literary Arts Competition sponsored by the Chosun Ilbo and Change of Season (Hwanjeolgi), which won a prize in a 1968 open playwriting competition co-sponsored by the National Theater and the Kyunghyang Daily News. In 1968 and 1969 his plays Change of Season (Hwanjeolgi), Judas, Before the Rooster Crows (Yudayeo dalgi ulgi jeone), Outing (Gyohaeng), and Self Righting Doll on Roller Skates (Lollaseukeiteureul taneun ottugi) were performed in several avant-garde theaters. He next took up residence with the Dongnang Repertory Company (Dongnang lepeoteori geukdan), where he directed Lubeu, and continues to direct and write today.

<doc id="41068985" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41068985" title="Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust">
Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust

Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust is an NHS trust which runs three hospitals in Worcestershire, England: The Alexandra Hospital, Redditch, Kidderminster Hospital and Treatment Centre in Kidderminster, Evesham hospital Burlingham ward in Evesham and the Worcestershire Royal Hospital in Worcester.

Services in Kidderminster and Redditch have been under threat for many years. Proposals to downgrade Kidderminster hospital provoked the establishment of Independent Community and Health Concern. Their candidate Dr Richard Taylor defeated David Lock the sitting Labour MP in the 2001 general election. The building of the new Treatment Centre, in Kidderminster was handled by Durrow healthcare consultancy.

In November 2013 further proposals to reduce services in Redditch were opposed by Redditch, Bromsgrove and Stratford councils who claimed "The removal of services from Redditch will leave what is already a vulnerable society, with the worst accessibility to health services in the region, and will introduce substantial inequalities with the populations of Redditch, Bromsgrove, Studley, Alcester and neighbouring areas being significantly worse off than all other areas in Worcestershire."

The trust is currently under the leadership of chief executive Matthew Hopkins who joined the trust during January 2019 and Sir David Nicholson KCB CBE who was appointed interim Chair of the trust in May 2018.

In November 2018 it was announced that the Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue Service's community risk team would be running an enhanced hospital from home service to help discharge patients from the hospital in Redditch for six months.

The Trust opened a new cancer treatment unit which has three linear accelerators in January 2015, a partnership with University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, which it hopes will treat about 1,500 patients per year who previously had to travel for radiotherapy. It is also intended to extend the chemotherapy services available on the site.

In December 2013 the Trust had to cancel non-urgent operations and appointments due to increased pressure on their A&E units.

In April 2014 it was revealed that the Trust had mislaid up to 270,000 ultrasound scans which were stored on obsolete technology dating back to 2004. Andrew Brown, whose complaints led to this revelation had been labelled a ‘vexatious complainant’ after raising concerns about his treatment at Worcestershire Royal Hospital over several years.

The Trust's former Chief Operating Officer, Stewart Messer, attempted to ban Stuart Gardner, a UNISON representative of the West Midlands Ambulance Service from Trust premises in January after he told the BBC about 18 patients being treated in corridors at the Worcester Royal Hospital. Messer claimed the staff were upset. The Trust later agreed with the union they did not have the authority to ban the paramedic from its premises and an apology was issued for suggesting he should be. Nurses at the Alexandra Hospital complained of serious bullying by their seniors. In February it was reported that four emergency consultants had resigned from the Woodrow Drive hospital and another emergency consultant had resigned from the Worcestershire Royal Hospital. Consequently, the future of the Alexandra Hospital Accident and Emergency department was in doubt. Their resignation letter accused “successive management decisions” of undermining services at the Alexandra, which they say has “led to the self-fulfilling prophecy of failing and unsustainable services” and that the proposed service model would be “neither an A&E service nor a safe service”. In April, after a major incident at Worcestershire Royal Hospital, when seven patients had to be cared for in a corridor, Neal Stote, chairman of the Save the Alex campaign claimed that reconfiguration plans meant that "Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust is trying to make us go to a hospital which is not only hard to get to but a hospital which, when you get there, is unable to cope." The Care Quality Commission carried out an inspection of the trust's accident and emergency departments in March. They found numerous examples where patient safety was at risk. Medication was not given in a timely manner, patient notes were not up-to-date and there were "inadequate" security arrangements. In September Redditch and Bromsgrove Clinical Commissioning Group asked local GPs not to refer patients to the Trust over the next three months because it was unable to treat patients within 18 weeks of referral. Waiting times were out of control in ear, nose and throat, trauma and orthopedics, gynaecology, general surgery and dermatology. 2,347 patients had waited more than 18 weeks. 11 patients were infected after treatment at the Alexandra Hospital endoscopy unit, seven with Pseudomonas and four with Serratia. The machines for decontaminating endoscopes were more than eight years old and in need of replacement. The trust was put into special measures in December 2015 after a Care Quality Commission inspection in July. It was still rated inadequate in June 2017, and performance, particularly in emergency care, had deteriorated.

The trust was singled out by the West Midlands Ambulance Service as one of two in the region responsible for the most serious delays in ambulance turn around times.

Two patients died while waiting on hospital trolleys in corridors at Worcester Royal Hospital during the 2017 New Year period. Many other patients at Worcester Royal Hospital during the first week of January spoke of long waits, patients in corridors, overstretched staff doing their best. Similar problems are in other NHS hospitals. A patient died from an overdose of DNP, which overworked medical staff failed to recognise in time. In December the trust diverted emergency patients away from the A&Es at two hospitals, the Worcestershire Royal Hospital and the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch. During the winter the trust had to divert emergency patients elsewhere at least 65 times. 35% of patients with suspected cancer waited longer than two weeks to see a cancer specialist though 93% of patients should be seen within that time.

In 2017-18 only 78.9% of A&E patients were seen within four hours.

Eight year old Callum Cartlidge died after Worcestershire Royal Hospital failed to do a blood test and misdiagnosed his condition. The coroner described this as "a failure to provide basic medical care". If the illness had been identified the boy would have survived. The Carnall Farrar consultancy was engaged to review emergency care in the trust in January. They found that 700 patients a month were waiting more than 12 hours in the emergency department before being admitted or discharged, far more than the trust had reported. Waiting in corridors had "largely been normalised and accepted as standard practice” and ambulance handover delays were worsening. In September the trust announced that it needed 208 extra beds, increasing its current bed base by nearly a third, to reach a relatively safe occupancy level of 91%.

The trust performs about 95,000 planned and emergency operations each year, with 140,000 A&E attendances and about 500,000 outpatient appointments.
In September 2015 it predicted a deficit of £58 million against turnover of £364 million. It had been given a temporary working capital facility of £19m. The 30-year private finance initiative scheme at the Worcestershire Royal Hospital which runs until 2032 costs the trust about £13.6m a year. In February 2016 it was expecting a deficit of £65 million for the year 2015/6.

In 2019 it rejected a proposal by NHS Improvement to achieve a £64.4 million deficit for 2019-20 and would only accept a target £73 million deficit, about the same as the result achieved in 2018-9. It has opened nearly 100 additional beds at a cost of about £22.5 million.

<doc id="41069188" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41069188" title="Discovery and development of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors">
Discovery and development of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors

Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a superfamily of enzymes. This superfamily is further classified into 11 families, PDE1 - PDE11, on the basis of regulatory properties, amino acid sequences, substrate specificities, pharmacological properties and tissue distribution. Their function is to degrade intracellular second messengers such as cyclic adenine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) which leads to several biological processes like effect on intracellular calcium level by the Ca pathway.

Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) is widely expressed in several tissues in the body for example brain, lung, kidney, urinary bladder, smooth muscle and platelets. It is possible to prevent cGMP hydrolysis by inhibiting PDE5 and therefore treat diseases associated with low cGMP levels, because of this, PDE5 is an ideal target for the development of inhibitors.

The three major PDE5 inhibitors (a subset of the phosphodiesterase inhibitors) are sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil.

The human genome contains at least 21 genes involved in determining the intracellular levels of cAMP and cGMP by the expression of phosphodiesterase proteins or PDE’s. These PDE’s are grouped into at least 11 functional subfamilies, named PDE1-PDE11. PDEs are enzymes that hydrolyze cyclic adenosine 3,5-monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine 3,5-monophospahate (cGMP), which are intracellular second messengers, into AMP and GMP. These second messengers control many physiological processes.
The cAMP is formed from ATP by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase and cGMP is formed from GTP by the enzyme guanylyl cyclase which are either membrane bound or soluble in the cytosol. When soluble it functions as a receptor for nitric oxide (NO) (see figure 1).
Formation of cGMP initiates several reactions in the body including influence on cGMP ion channels, cGMP binding proteins and protein kinase G (PKG). The effect on PKG reduces levels of calcium leading to relaxation of smooth muscles (see figure 2). 
The PDE5 enzyme is specific for cGMP which means it only hydrolyzes cGMP but not cAMP. The selectivity is mediated through an intricate network of hydrogen bonding which is favorable for cGMP but unfavorable for cAMP in PDE5.
By inhibition of PDE5 enzyme the cGMP concentration will be raised and can therefore increase the relaxation of smooth muscles. PDE5 has only one subtype, PDE5A, of which there are 4 isoforms in humans called PDE5A1-4. The difference in PDE5A1-3 isoforms is only in the 5´ end of the mRNA and corresponding N-terminal of the protein. 

In humans the distribution of PDE5A1 and PDE5A2 isoforms is the same and can be found in the brain, lung tissue, heart, liver, kidneys, bladder, prostate, urethra, penis, uterus and skeletal muscles. PDE5A2 is more common than PDE5A1. PDE5A3 is not as widespread as the other two isoforms, and is only found in smooth muscle tissues, it is found in the heart, bladder, prostate, urethra, penis and uterus, Exact distribution of PDE5A4 isoform was not found in the literature. PDE5 enzyme in humans has also been reported in platelets, gastrointestinal epithelial cells, Purkinje cells of cerebellum, corpus cavernosum, pancreas, placenta and colon, clitoral corpus cavernosum as well as vaginal smooth muscle and epithelium.

PDE enzymes are composed of 3 functional domains: an N-terminal cyclin fold domain, a linker helical domain and a C-terminal helical bundle domain (see figure 3). The active site is a deep pocket at the junction of the 3 subdomains and is lined with highly conserved residues between isotypes of PDE. The pocket is approximately 15 Å deep and the opening is approximately 20 by 10 Å. The volume of the active site has been calculated to be between 875 and 927 Å. The active site of PDE5 has been described as subdivided into 3 main regions based on its crystal structure in complex with sildenafil: 
Jeon "et al." also describe a fourth pocket called the H pocket which is hydrophobic and accommodates the ethoxyphenyl group of sildenafil
The 3 PDE5 inhibitors already on the market, sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil, occupy part of the active site, mainly around the Q pocket and sometimes the M pocket as well and all 3 interact with the active site in 3 important manners:
It has also been described that the hydrophobic interaction with the Q1 and Q2 pockets are important for inhibitor potency and differences between isotypes of PDE in the Q2 pocket can be exploited for selectivity between isotypes.

Drugs that inhibit PDE5, sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil, have been used as treatment for erectile dysfunction. These inhibitors increase the cGMP, smooth muscle relaxation and consequently cause penis erection during sexual stimulation.

Pulmonary hypertension is the result of upregulation of PDE5 gene expression, causing vasoconstriction in the lung. PDE5 inhibitors are used as potent pulmonary vasodilators reducing Pulmonary hypertension and inhibiting vascular remodelling. Long-term treatment with a PDE5 inhibitor has been shown to enhance natriuretic peptide-cGMP pathway, downregulate Ca signaling pathway and alter vascular tone in pulmonary arteries in rat models.

Adding PDE5 inhibitors to SSRI drugs (e.g. paroxetine) for the treatment of premature ejaculation could result in better ejaculatory control according to recent studies. Possible mechanism is based on nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP transduction system as a central and peripheral mediator of inhibitory non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic nitrergic neurotransmission in the urogenital system.

PDE5 is expressed in clitoral corpus cavernosum and in vaginal smooth muscle and epithelium. Therefore, it is possible that PDE5 inhibitors could affect female sexual arousal disorder but further research is needed. Increased levels of cGMP have been shown to occur in human-cultured vaginal smooth muscle cells treated with a PDE5 inhibitor suggesting involvement of the NO/cGMP axis in the female sexual response.

The similarity of many PDE5 inhibitors to the structure of many of the analogs of caffeine that are also suggests that in the future, it may be possible to design an PDE5 inhibitor that, like caffeine, is also an adenosine antagonist.

Sildenafil has been shown to be effective in treating severe Raynaud's phenomenon associated with systemic sclerosis and digital ulceration. When given sildenafil for 4 weeks subjects had reduced mean frequency and duration of Raynaud attacks and a significantly lowered mean Raynaud’s condition score. The capillary blood flow velocity also increased in each individual patient and the mean capillary flow velocity of all patients increased significantly. These results came without significant reductions of the systemic blood pressure.

Sildenafil has shown promise in the treatment of congestive cardiac failure. A study showed that effective treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension with sildenafil improved functional capacity and reduced right ventricular mass in patients. The effects on right ventricular remodeling were significantly greater in comparison with the non-selective endothelia receptor antagonist bosentan.

Sildenafil has been shown to improve endothelial function in diabetes and congestive heart failure., It has also been shown to reduce aortic pressure through vasodilation, reduced arterial stiffness and wave reflection and could be used in the management of systemic hypertension.

Sildenafil has been shown to significantly improve neurovascular coupling without affecting overall cerebral blood flow by increasing brain levels of cGMP, evoking neurogenesis and reducing neurological deficits in rats 2 or 24 hours after stroke. This data suggest that PDE5 inhibitors may have a role in promoting recovery from stroke.,

PDE5 is an enzyme that was first purified in 1980 from a rats lung. PDE5 converts intracellular cGMP to the nucleotide GMP. Many tissues contain PDE5, such as lungs, kidneys, brain, platelets, liver, prostate, urethra, bladder and smooth muscles. Because of the localization of PDE5 in the smooth muscle tissue, inhibitors were developed for the treatment of erectile dysfunction along with pulmonary hypertension.

Sildenafil was initially introduced for clinical trial in 1989. It was the result of extensive research on chemical agents targeting PDE5 that could be effective in treatment of coronary heart disease. Sildenafil did not prove effective for coronary heart disease but an interesting side effect was discovered, a penile erection. That side effect soon became the main field of investigation. The inhibitor is highly selective for the PDE5 family.

Sildenafil is a prototype of PDE5 inhibitors that Pfizer launched as Viagra. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1998 as the first oral medicine for erectile dysfunction. Later, in the year 2005, it was approved for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Vardenafil and tadalafil were discovered in 1990. These drugs came out of research programs focusing on finding PDE5 inhibitors for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and erectile dysfunction.The two PDE5 inhibitors soon became treatments for these conditions.

Tadalafil is the most versatile inhibitor and has the longest half-life, 17,5 hours. This allows for a longer therapeutic window and is therefore often a more convenient drug than others with a shorter therapeutic window. Tadalafil is more bioavailable (80%) than sildenafil (40%) and vardenafil (15%) but it has a slow absorption, or about 2 hours compared to 50 minutes of sildenfil. Vardenafil is most known for its potency.

Because of severe adverse effects and patients dissatisfaction with current therapy choices other inhibitors have recently been approved for clinical use. These inhibitors are udenfil, avanafil lodenafil and mirodenafil.

Penile erection is a hemodynamic event in the smooth muscle of corpus cavernous. PDE5 is the main cGMP hydrolysing enzyme found in penile corpus cavernous. Erection is triggered by release of the neurotransmitter nitric oxide (NO) from non-adrenergic and non-cholinergic neurons from nerve ending in the penis as well as from endothelial cells. NO activates soluble guanylyl cyclase in smooth muscle cells in the penis which results in increased production of 3'-5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate from guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP). Cyclic GMP binds to the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG1) which phosphorylates several proteins that results in decreased intracellular calcium. Lower intracellular calcium leads to smooth muscle relaxation and ultimately penile erection. This pathway is demonstrated in .

PDE5 degrades cGMP and therefore inhibits erection. As demonstrated in , inhibition of PDE5 reduces degradation of cGMP and leads to penile erection.
Because of this action PDE5 inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of penile erectile dysfunction.

The PDE5 enzyme has a molecular mass of 200 kDa and its active state is a homodimer. PDE5 consists of monomers and each contains two major functional domains: the regulatory domain (R domain) which is located in the N-terminal portion of the protein and the catalytic domain (C domain) located in the more C-terminal portion of the protein.

The R domain contains specific allosteric cGMP binding site that controls the enzymes function. This specific binding site consists of subdomain GAF (cGMP-specific cGMP-stimulated PDE, adenylate cyclase, and FhlA) which is located in the N-terminal section of the specific proteins. The allosteric binding site GAF consists of GAFa and GAFb where GAFa has a higher binding affinity. The importance and functional role of the two homologous binding sites are unknown.

Conformational change occurs when cGMP binds to the allosteric site that exposes serine and permits phosphorylation. The results for the phosphorylation of serine leads to increased cGMP hydrolysis at the catalytic domain. The affinity of the catalytic domain for cGMP increases and further increases the PDE5 catalytic domain activity.
Through the C domain, intracellular cGMP is degraded rapidly by PDE5 which minimizes the activity of cGMP on its PKG1 substrate by cleaving the cyclic phosphate part of cGMP to GMP. GMP is an inactive molecule with no second messenger activity.

Phosphorylation of a single serine by PKG1 and the allosteric cGMP binding site activates the PDE5 catalytic activity and the result is a negative feedback regulation of cGMP/NO/PKG1 signalling. cGMP therefore interacts with both allosteric and catalytic domain of the PDE5 enzyme and PDE5 inhibitors compete with cGMP for binding at the catalytic domain resulting in higher cGMP levels. PDE5 domains are demonstrated in .

The PDE5 inhibitors sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil are competitive and reversible inhibitors of cGMP hydrolysis by the catalytic side of PDE5. The structures of vardenafil and sildenafil are similar, they both contain similar structured purine ring of cGMP that contributes their features to act as a competitive inhibitor of PDE5. The difference of the molecular structures is the reason for interaction with the catalytic site of PDE5 and improves the affinity of these compounds compared with cGMP selectivity.

The pharmacophore model of PDE5 usually consists of one hydrogen bond acceptor, one hydrophobic aliphatic carbon chain and two aromatic rings. Small hydrophobic pocket and H-loop of PDE5 enzyme are important for binding affinity of PDE5 inhibitors. As well as positional and conformational changes are observed upon inhibitor binding in many cases.

The active site of PDE5 is located at a helical bundle domain at the center of C domain (catalytic domain). The substrate pocket is composed of four subsites: M site (metal-binding site), Q pocket (core pocket), H pocket (hydrophobic pocket) and L region (lid region) as demonstrated in figure 3. The Q pocket accommodates the pyrazolopyrimidinone group of sildenafil. That suggest that other chemicals similar to guanidine groups of cGMP can also bind at this region. The amino acids residues, Gln817, Phe820, Val782 and Tyr612, are lined in the Q pocket, they are highly conserved in all PDEs. The amide moiety of the pyrazolopyrimidinone group forms a bidentate hydrogen bond with the ɣ-amide group of Gln817. 3D structure of sildenafil is demonstrated in figure 4.

No serious side effects have occurred in clinical trials although serious adverse effects have been recognized. For those who are taking nitrates parallel PDE5 inhibitors systemic hypotension may occur and therefore patients should not take nitrates with PDE5 inhibitors. Hearing impairment is one risk factor for those who are using PDE5 inhibitors and it has been reported for all three available drugs on the market. This problem may be due to high level effect cGMP on cochlear hair cells. 
It has been reported that PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil & vardenafil) cause moderate-severe visual disturbances likely due to PDE6 inhibition, but recent large trial and case review found no increase in ocular risk in patient taking sildenafil.

These side effects can be attributed to the limited selectivity of PDE5 inhibitors against other PDE isozyme such as PDE1 and PDE6. That is why it is important to improve selectivity of PDE5 inhibitors that potentially would lead to fewer side effects. Vardenafil and Tadalafil have demonstrated reduced adverse effects probably due to improved selectivity for PDE5.

Several reports are about approaches to improve PDE5 inhibitors, where as chemical groups have been switched out to increase potency and selectivity, which should potentially lead to drugs with fewer side effects.

Sildenafil, the first PDE5 inhibitor, was discovered through rational drug design programme. The compound was potent and selective over PDE5 but was lacking preferable pharmacological properties.

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) is demonstrated in figure 5, figure 6 and figure 7. Figure 5 demonstrates the three main groups of sildenafil, R1, R2 and R3. R1 is the pyrazolopyrimidinone ring, R2 the ethoxyphenyl ring and R3 is the methylpiperazine ring. R1 group is responsible for the binding of the drug to its active binding site of PDE5.
Solubility is one of the pharmacological properties that was increased. A group was substituted for the hydrogen atom as demonstrated in figure 6. The sulfonamide group was chosen to lower lipophilicity and increase solubility as seen in figure 7.
Solubility was further increased by placing a methyl group at R positions as demonstrated in figure 7. Other phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors were developed from the structure in figure 7.
Although PDE5 inhibitors main use has been for erectile dysfunction there has been a great interest in PDE5 inhibitors as a promising new therapeutic agents for treatment of other diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Elevation of cGMP levels through inhibition of PDE5 provides a way of improving memory and learning.
PDE5 has also been considered as a potential therapeutic agent for parasitic disease such as African sleeping sickness. Strategic changes were made to the structure of sildenafil so the molecule could project into a parasite-specific pocket (the p-pocket). Similar approach has been used to design therapeutic agents "Plasmodium falciparum".

Texas Association

The Texas Association was a minor baseball league based in Texas. A league by that name first appeared in 1896, but folded following the season. A new league by that name returned in 1923 and played until 1926.

The initial Texas Association consisted of six teams - the Austin Senators, Dallas Navigators, Denison Tigers, Fort Worth Panthers, Galveston Sandcrabs, Houston Buffaloes, San Antonio Missionaries and Sherman Students. The Students disbanded in June and were replaced by the Paris Midlands, a semi-professional team. Denison, Fort Worth, Dallas and Paris disbanded on August 2. Houston finished in first place and beat second-place finisher Galveston in the playoffs to win the league championship. Notable players in the league that year include Kid Elberfeld, Warren Wallace Beckwith and Harry Steinfeldt.

The league ceased operations following the 1896 season, but returned in 1923 with a six-team format. The Austin Rangers, Corsicana Oilers, Marlin Bathers, Mexia Gushers, Sherman-Denison Twins and Waco Indians made up the league that year, with Mexia finishing first in the league. Despite Mexia's first-place finish, it was second- and third-place finishers Austin and Sherman, respectively, that played in the playoffs, which ended in a tie.

The Sherman-Denison squad did not return for 1924 and was replaced by the Temple Surgeons. All other teams returned. Corsicana finished in first place and Temple in last. No playoffs were held that season. Jack Smith, who spent 15 seasons in Major League Baseball, played for the Marlin squad that season.

For 1925, the Austin Rangers became the Austin Senators, while the Waco club did not return - it was replaced by the Terrell Terrors. All other teams returned. On May 13, Marlin moved to Palestine to become the Palestine Pals. With an 85-48 record, Corsicana finished in first place that season. Minor league legend Smead Jolley played for Corsicana that year, while 12-year major league veteran Boom-Boom Beck suited up for the Marlin/Palestine club. 1926 was the final year of the Texas Association. All six teams returned from the previous year. Austin finished in first place, but lost in the playoffs three games to zero to second-place finisher Palestine.

No effort was made to bring the league back for 1927. Palestine, Mexia and Corsicana moved to the Lone Star League, while Austin, Terrell and Temple ceased operations. Professional baseball would return to Austin in 1956, but Terrell and Temple have yet to field another team.

Discovery and development of beta-blockers

β adrenergic receptor antagonists (also called beta-blockers or β-blockers) were initially developed in the 1960s, for the treatment of angina pectoris but are now also used for hypertension, congestive heart failure and certain arrhythmias. In the 1950s, dichloroisoproterenol (DCI) was discovered to be a β-antagonist that blocked the effects of sympathomimetic amines on bronchodilation, uterine relaxation and heart stimulation. Although DCI had no clinical utility, a change in the compound did provide a clinical candidate, pronethalol, which was introduced in 1962.

The β-blockers are an immensely important class of drugs due to their high prevalence of use. The discovery of β-blockers reaches back to more than 100 years ago, when early investigators came up with the idea that catecholamines were binding selectively to receptor-like structures and that this was the cause of their pharmacological actions. In 1948, Raymond P. Ahlquist published a seminal paper concluding his findings, that there were two distinct receptors for catecholamine drugs, and they caused different responses in the heart muscle. He labeled them α-and β-adrenoceptors. These findings were soon to be a foundation for further research into drug development.

In the early 1960s, James Black, a Scottish pharmacologist, and associates of his at the Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in Great Britain were working on a series of β-adrenergic blocking compounds, pronethalol and propranolol. Dr. Black focused on developing a drug that would relieve the pain of angina pectoris, which results from oxygen deprivation in the heart. His plan was to create a drug that would decrease the heart’s requirement for oxygen. He hypothesized that these compounds would lower the heart’s oxygen consumption by interfering with the effects of catecholamines. In 1958, the pharmacological properties of dichloroisoproterenol (DCI) were described, a β-antagonist discovered a few years before by the Eli Lilly group. It was the synthesis of DCI which established that β-receptors could be chemically blocked and thus its existence could be confirmed. DCI had no clinical utility but a replacement of the 3,4-dichloro substituents, with a carbon bridge to form a naphtylethanolamine derivative, afforded a clinical candidate, pronethalol.

In April 1963, toxicity tests for pronethalol showed results of thymic tumours in mice. Nevertheless, it was launched under the trade name Alderlin, as the first clinically useful β-blocker. The launch took place in November 1963 when many small-scale clinical trials had proved their effectiveness in angina and certain types of arrhythmias. Pronethalol was only marketed for use in life-threatening situations. Dr. James Black went on to create another β-blocker, called propranolol; a non-selective β-blocker. Clinical trials started in the summer of 1964 and a year later, propranolol was launched under the trade name Inderal, only two and a half years after it had first been tested. It turned out to have a higher potency than pronethalol, with fewer side effects. Propranolol became the first major drug in the treatment of angina pectoris, since the introduction of coronary vasodilators, (such as nitroglycerin), almost 100 years earlier. Propranolol became a best-selling drug, used to treat a wide range of cardiovascular diseases such as arrhythmia, hypertension and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

By the time propranolol was launched, ICI was beginning to experience competition from other companies. This potential threat led to ongoing refinements in the pharmacologic structure of β-blockers and subsequent advances in drug delivery. ICI studied analogues further and in 1970 launched practolol (figure 4) under the trade name Eraldin. It was withdrawn from the market a few years later because of the severe side effects it caused, nevertheless it played a large role in the fundamental study of β-blockade and β-receptors.
The withdrawal of Eraldin gave ICI the nudge to launch another β-blocker, atenolol, which was launched in 1976 under the trade name Tenormin. Atenolol is a selective β1-receptor antagonist and was developed for the purpose of obtaining the “ideal β-blocker”. It soon became one of the best-selling heart drug. ICI’s β-blocker project was based on Ahlquist’s dual receptor theory. The drugs that were the outcome of this project, from propranolol to atenolol, helped to establish the receptor theory among scientist and pharmaceutical companies.

The progress in β-blocker development led to the introduction of drugs with variety of properties. β-blockers were developed having a relative selectivity for cardiac β1-receptors (for example metoprolol and atenolol), partial adrenergic agonist activity (pindolol), concomitant α-adrenergic blocking activity (for example labetalol and carvedilol) and additional direct vasodilator activity (nebivolol). In addition, long-acting and ultra-short formulations of β-blockers were developed. In 1988, Sir James Black was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work on drug development.

The β-adrenergic receptor antagonists all have similar therapeutic and pharmacodynamic actions in patients with cardiovascular disorders. They vary greatly in their pharmacokinetic properties, as they demonstrate a high range of values in plasma protein binding, the percent of drug eliminated by metabolism or unchanged in the urine and hepatic extraction ratio. Each of the β-blockers possesses at least one chiral centre and a high degree of enantioselectivity when binding to the β-adrenergic receptor. For those β-blockers containing a single chiral centre, the (-) enantiomer has a much higher affinity in binding to the β-adrenergic receptor than the (+) enantiomer. All β-blockers used systemically are delivered as racemate, except for timolol.

Three different types of β-adrenergic receptors have been identified by molecular pharmacology. β1-receptors are located in the heart and consist of about 75% of all β-receptors. β2-receptors can be found in the smooth muscles of vessels and the bronchies. β3-receptors are presumed to be involved in fatty acid metabolism and are found in the adipocytes. β-blockers cause a competitive inhibition of the β-receptor, which counters the effects of catecholamines. β1 and β2-receptors are G-protein coupled receptors, which couple to Gαs-proteins. When activated, it stimulates an increase in intracellular cAMP via the adenylyl cyclase. cAMP, which is the second messenger, then activates protein kinase A that phosphorylates the membrane's calcium channel and increases the entry of calcium into the cytosol. Protein kinase A also increases the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which causes a positive inotropic effect. The phosphorylation of troponin I and phospholamban by protein kinase A causes the lusitropic effects of β-blockers. This increases the re-uptake of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

β-blockers are sympatholytic drugs. Some β-blockers partially activate the receptor while preventing catecholamines from binding to the receptor, making them partial agonists. They provide a background of sympathetic activity, while preventing normal and enhanced sympathetic activity. These β-blockers possess intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). Some of them also possess what is called membrane-stabilizing activity (MSA) on myocardial muscle fibers.

β-blockers can be selective for either β, β adrenergic receptor, or to be non-selective. By blocking β receptor it is possible to reduce heart rate, conduction of velocity and contractility. The blocking of β receptor promotes vascular smooth muscle contraction, which results in increase of peripheral resistance. Blockade of the β receptor effectively reduces the sympathetic activity, which results in reduce of the associated platelet-and coagulation activation. This is why a non-selective β-blocker treatment may result in a lower risk of both arterial and venous embolic events.

Synthesis for a standard β-blocker begins with the mono-alkylation of catechol to give an ether (see figure 4).

The fundamental step, and usually the last, in the synthesis of β-blockers consists of adding a propanolamine side chain. This can be done following two paths which both involve alkylation of an appropriate phenoxide with epichlorohydrin (ECH). The first way is shown as the upper way in figure 5. It consists of phenoxide reacting at the oxirane and resulting in an alkoxide, that displaces the adjacent chloride to form a new epoxide ring. The second way is shown as the lower route in figure 5. It consists of displacement of the halogen directly with a S2 reaction to give the same glycidic ether. When following both pathways, the central chiral carbon preserves its configuration, which is an important part to consider when synthesizing enantiomerically defined drugs. The ring opening of the epoxide ring in glycidic ether is done with an appropriate amine, such as isopropyl amine or tert-butylamine, and leads to the aryloxypropanolamine compound that consist of a secondary amine. This amine is typically known as the structural requirement for the β-adrenergic blocking activity.

Propranolol exist in two different enantiomers, ("S")-(−)- and ("R")-(+)-enantiomers. The ("S")-isomer is 100-fold more potent than the ("R")-isomer and that is the general rule for most β-blockers. It is possible to produce the ("S")-propranolol enantiomer from α-naphthol and 3-bromopropanol as seen in figure 6. α-Naphthol and 3-bromopropanol are refluxed for 6 hours to give alcohol. The alcohol is oxidized by using 2-Iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX) to give aldehyde. The aldehyde is subjected to -proline catalyzed asymmetric α-aminoxylation and a reduction is made with NaBH in methanol. A diol is obtained by Pd/C-catalyzed hydrogenolysis. Finally the diol is converted to epoxide using the Mitsunobu reaction and stirred with isopropyl amine in CHCl to give ("S")-propranolol.

β-blockers' binding site to the receptor is the same as for endogenous catecholamines, such as noradrenaline and adrenaline. This binding is based on hydrogen bonds between the β-blocker and the receptor, and therefore not based on covalent bonds, which results in the reversibility of the binding. A significant step in the development of β adrenergic antagonists was the discovery that an oxymethylene bridge (—OCH—, figure 7) could be inserted into the arylethanolamine structure of pronethalol to produce propranolol. Propranolol is an aryloxypropanolamine, which are more potent β-blockers than arylethanolamines. Today, most of the β-blockers used clinically are aryloxypropanolamines. The length of the side chain is increased when an oxymethylene bridge is introduced. It has been shown that the side chains of aryloxypropanolamine can adopt a conformation that puts the hydroxyl and amine groups in more or less the same position as with beta blocker that do not have this group as a part of the side chain.

After the release of propranolol, relative lipophilicity of β-blockers as a significant factor in their varied and complex pharmacology, became an important factor. It was suspected that propranolol's centrally induced side effects could be due to its high lipophilicity. Thus, it was focused on synthesizing analogues with hydrophilic moieties, favourably placed to see if the side effects would decrease. Selecting "para"-acylamino groups as the hydrophilic moiety, scientists synthesized a group of "para"-acylphenoxyethanol and propanolamines, and selected practolol for clinical trials. Practolol had one property not previously seen with β-blockers, it exhibited cardioselectivity (β selectivity). Studies from practolol showed that moving the acylamino group to meta or ortho positions, on the benzene ring, caused a loss of selectivity but not loss of the β-blockade itself. This illustrated the significance of "para"-substitution for β selectivity of β-blockers.
Figure 8 shows the structure-activity relationship (SAR) for β-blockers. For the function of a β-blocker it's essential for the compound to contain an aromatic ring and a β-ethanolamine. The aromatic ring can either be benzoheterocyclic (such as indole) or heterocyclic (such as thiadiazole). This is mandatory. The side chains can be variable:

The general rule for aromatic substitution is: "ortho" > "meta" > "para". This gives non-selective β-blockers. Large para-substituents usually decrease activity but large ortho-groups retain some activity. Polysubstitution on carbon 2 and 6 makes the compound inactive but when the substitution is on carbon 3 and 5 there's some activity. For the highest cardioselectivity, the substituents should be as following: "para" > "meta" > "ortho". All the β-blockade is in one isomer, ("S")-aryloxypropylamine and ("R")-ethanolamine.

For decades β-blockers have been used in cardiovascular medicine. They have proved to reduce morbidity and mortality. In acute coronary syndrome, β-blockers have been recommended as a class I-A indication in clinical practice guidelines, because the treatment decreases the mortality rate. β-blockers, along with calcium channel blockers, reduce the workload of the heart and its oxygen requirement. β-blockers are sometimes used in a combination therapy to treat angina, if a β-blocker doesn't work well enough on its own. They are used as anti-arrhythmic drugs in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiac dysrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and ventricular tachycardia. The treatment with β-blockers reduces the incidence of sudden heart failure when the patient has already had a myocardial infarction. The reason is probably because of their anti-arrhythmic effects and also anti-ischemic effects. A β-blocker therapy is also useful in myocardial infarction, independent to heart failure. The therapy has been very helpful for high-risk patients. All β-blockers are able to lower blood pressure and therefore are they the first choice of drugs for hypertension. But if they are used along with calcium channel blockers, β-blockers have more functionality. They also have an effect on cardiomyopathy, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and portal hypertension, to name a few.

There are few diseases, other than cardiovascular diseases, that β-blockers have a clinical effect on. These diseases are mentioned in the following sub-chapters. In addition, there are diseases which β-blockers have a clinical effect but are not the first choice of treatment. They won't be mentioned in the sub-chapters.

When symptoms of the essential tremors are considerably high, non-selective β-blockers are an important treatment option and usually the first choice. Studies have shown that propranolol did reduce symptoms the most in that category. The β-blockers can be used alone or in a combination.

Glaucoma is caused by high intra-ocular pressure (IOP). β-blockers reduce IOP and are the most common therapy. Most of the patients, who use the topical β-blockers, need adjunctive therapy to achieve a target IOP lowering. One of the most used drug in adjunctive therapy is dorzolamide.

Hypertension is reported to complicate one out of ten pregnancies, which makes it the most common medical disorder in pregnancy. It is important to have a correct diagnosis of hypertension during pregnancy, with the emphasis on differentiating pre-existing hypertension from pregnancy induced hypertension (gestational and the syndrome of pre-eclampsia). During pregnancy, the challenge is to determine when to use antihypertensive medications and which level of blood pressure to target. A balance has to be found between the potential risk to the health of the baby related to drug-exposure and the risk to the mother and baby due to an untreated medical condition (severe hypertension).

Antihypertensive drug use during pregnancy is relatively common and increasing. Only a small proportion of available antihypertensive drugs have been tested in pregnant women, and many are contraindicated. It is important to make the exposure of medications to the baby as small as possible. It is not clear if treating women who have mild or moderate hypertension during pregnancy with anti-hypertensive medication is beneficial.
The most common first trimester antihypertensive are β-blockers. The consequences of treatment with β-blocker during pregnancy are disputable. Some studies report a connection between β-blocker treatment and small for-gestational-age (SGA) of newborns and pre-term birth, while others do not. Based on meta-analyses, first trimester oral β-blocker use showed no increase in odds of major congenital anomalies. However, analyses examining organ-specific malformations observed increased odds of cardiovascular defects, cleft lip and neural tube defects. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) categorises β-blockers into different pregnancy categories depending on the safety of the drugs and they range from categorie B to D, that is, no β-blockers is completely safe for using during pregnancy

<doc id="41069253" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41069253" title="GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator">
GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator

In pharmacology, GABA receptor positive allosteric modulators are positive allosteric modulator (PAM) molecules that increase the activity of the GABA receptor protein in the vertebrate central nervous system.

GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Upon binding, it triggers the GABAreceptor to open its chloride channel to allow chloride ions into the neuron, making the cell hyperpolarized and less likely to fire. GABAPAMs increase the effect of GABA by making the channel open more frequently or for longer periods. However, they have no effect if GABA or another agonist is not present.

Unlike GABA receptor agonists, GABAPAMs do not bind at the same active site as the γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter molecule: they affect the receptor by binding at a different site on the protein. This is called allosteric modulation.

In psychopharmacology, GABA receptor PAMs used as drugs have mainly sedative and anxiolytic effects. Examples of GABA PAMs include alcohol (ethanol), benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium) and alprazolam (Xanax), Z-drugs such as zolpidem (Ambien) and the barbiturate drugs.
The GABA receptors have historically been a target of drug treatment research. The earliest compounds were ions, such as bromide.

In 1903, the first psychoactive derivative of barbituric acid was synthesized and marketed for headaches. Within 30 years, many other barbiturates were developed and found use as sedatives, sleep aids and general anesthetics. Although barbiturates fell out of favor, they continue to serve as a short-acting anesthetic and anti-epileptic drugs.

Benzodiazepines were discovered in 1948 and largely replaced the barbiturates because of their larger therapeutic index. At first benzodiazepines were considered to be safe and efficient minor tranquilizers but then were criticized for their dependence producing effects. Several efficient benzodiazepines offer choices about dosage form, length of action, metabolic interaction and safety.

Benzodiazepines function by binding to the benzodiazepine site on most, but not all, GABA receptors. GABA modulation by benzodiazepine site agonists is self-limiting. The channel conductance is not higher in the presence of benzodiazepine and GABA than the conductance with the presence of only high GABA concentrations. Additionally, in the absence of GABA the presence of benzodiazepines alone does not open the chloride channel.

Certain metabolites of progesterone and deoxycorticosterone are potent and selective positive allosteric modulators of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA) receptor. Hans Selye demonstrated in the 1940 that certain pregnane steroids could cause both anesthesia and sedation but 40 years later the molecular mechanism emerged to explain their depressant effect. In a rat brain slice preparation, the synthetic steroidal anesthetic alphaxalone (5α-pregnan-3α-ol-11,20 dione) enhanced both stimulus-evoked inhibition and the effects of exogenously applied muscimol which is a GABA selective agonist.

The GABA receptors are made up of subunits which form a receptor complex. Humans have 19 receptor subunits and are classified into α (1–6), β (1–3), γ (1–3), δ, ε, π, θ, and ρ (1−3). The function of the receptor is different according to how the pentameric complex is put together. The most common complex that includes around 40% of the GABA receptors is the α1β2γ2 combination. The expression of the subunits can be very different depending on brain region. The combination of the subunits influences how the receptor acts. For example, if the α1 and β2 subunits are expressed together they have high sensitivity to GABA, but low channel conductance. But if the γ2 is expressed with α1 and β2 the sensitivity is low and channel conductance is high. γ2 subunit has to be present for high affinity binding of benzodiazepine. Little is known about where different complexes are located in the brain, complicating drug discovery. For example, the binding site of neurosteroids in the GABA receptor is not known and barbiturates bind at a beta subunit that is distinct from the benzodiazepine binding site.


Barbiturates' precise action sites have not yet been defined. The second and third transmembrane domains of the β subunit appear to be critical; binding may involve a pocket formed by β-subunit methionine 286 as well as α-subunit methionine 236.

Barbiturates were introduced as hypnotics for patients with schizophrenia. It induced a state of deep and prolonged sleep. But this was not used for long because of adverse side effects.

Phenobarbital was the first truly effective drug against epilepsy. It was discovered by accident when given to epileptic patients to help them sleep. The positive side effects were anticonvulsant properties that reduced seizure number and intensity.

Pentobarbital is used as a hypnotic when analgesia is not required. It´s often used in CT imaging when sedation is needed. It is efficient, safe and the recovery time is short. In 2013 the barbiturates phenobarbital and butabarbital are still used as sedatives in certain cases as well as to antagonize the effects of drugs as ephedrine and theophylline. Phenobarbital is used in cases of drug withdrawal syndromes. It is used as normal and emergency treatment in some cases of epilepsy.

Synaptic action of benzodiazepines: GABA receptors located at synapses are activated when they are exposed to high concentration of GABA. Benzodiazepines enhance the receptor affinity for GABA by decreasing the decay of spontaneous miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSC).

Sedative actions of benzodiazepines limit their usefulness as analgesic agents and they are therefore generally not considered to be appropriate. This limitation can be bypassed by intrathecal administration. GABA receptors in the periaqueductal gray are pro-nociceptive at supraspinal sites while GABA that are found in the spinal cord are anti-hyperalgesic. Spinal α2 and α3 containing GABA receptors are responsible for the anti-hyperalgesic action of intrathecal diazepam. This was shown when the anti-hyperalgesic action was reduced when administered in α2 and α3 mice in inflammatory pain and in neuropathic pain. Additionally, studies in α5 mice showed that the spinal α5-containing GABA receptor has a minor role in inflammatory pain. An α2, α3 and/or α5 selective positive allosteric agonist, like L-838,427 for example, might be useful as an analgesic drug against inflammatory or neuropathic pain.

Benzodiazepines are used as a supporting treatment in patients with schizophrenia.

GABA ergic hypothesis for depression has been proposed. This hypothesis places the GABA system in a central role in the pathophysiology of depression and in addition to that clinical studies have shown that alprazolam and adinazolam have antidepressant activities in patients with major depressive disorder. Unfortunately we do not know which receptor subtype is responsible for the antidepressant activities. Studies in y2 knockout mice have shown that they display increased anxiety and depressive-like symptoms in despair based tests. The mice also had increased corticosterone concentration which is a symptom in major depression in humans. The y2 subunit is associated with α1-α6 subunits, which are all known α subunits, so these studies do not show which of the α subunits are related to the depressive like symptoms. Other studies with α2 knockout mice have displayed increased anxiety and depression-like symptoms in conflict based feeding tests and the fact that anxiety and depression are often linked seems to indicate that the α2 subunit might be a valid target for a GABA antidepressant.

Preclinical studies have shown that benzodiazepines can be effective in reducing the effect of strokes for up to three days after the drug has been administered.

Neurosteroids can act as allosteric modulators of neurotransmitter receptors, such as the GABA, NMDA, and sigma receptors. The neurosteroid Progesterone (PROG) that activates progesterone receptors expressed in peripheral and central glial cells. Additionally it has been surmised that the 3α-hydroxy ring A-reduced pregnane steroids allopregnanolone and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone increase the GABA-mediated chloride currents while pregnenolone sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) sulfate on the other hand display antagonistic properties at the GABA receptors.

Barbituric acid is the parent compound of barbiturate drugs although barbituric acid itself is not pharmacologically active. Barbiturates were synthesized in 1864 by Adolf von Baeyer by combining urea and malonic acid (Figure 5). A synthesis process was later developed and perfected by French chemist Edouard Grimaux in 1879, making possible the subsequent widespread development of barbiturate derivatives. Malonic acid was later replaced by diethyl malonate, as using the ester avoids the need to deal with the acidity of the carboxylic acid and its unreactive carboxylate (see figure 6). Barbituric acid can form a large variety of barbiturate drugs by using the Knoevenagel condensation reaction.

The structure that the first benzodiazepine is based on was discovered by Leo H. Sternbach. He thought the compound had a heptoxdiazine structure (Figure 7) but it was later determined to be a quinazoline-3-oxide. Possible drug candidates were then synthesized from that compound and screened for activity. One of these compounds was active, chlordiazepoxide. It was marketed in 1960 and became the first benzodiazepine drug.

Neurosteroids are synthesized in the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) from cholesterol and steroidal precursors that are imported from the peripheral sources. These sources include 3β-hydroxy-Δ5 derivatives, such as pregnenolone (PREG) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), their sulfates, and reduced metabolites such as the tetrahydro derivative of progesterone 3α-hydroxy-5α-pregnane-20-one (3α,5α-THPROG). After the local synthesis or from metabolism of adrenal of gonadal steroids many neurosteroids accumulate in the brain.

Barbiturates have special uses and are organized into 4 classes: ultrashort-, short-, intermediate- and long-acting. Empirically SARs of barbiturants are based on thousands of (animal) tested compounds.They have shown that R and R´ may not be H in position 5 (see figure 8). Also, position 5 confer sedative-hypnotic properties. Generally alkyl branching in position 5 means less lipid solubility and less activity. Unsaturation show less activity in position 5 and alicyclic and aromatic rings show less potency. Polar substiuents (-NH, -OH, -COOH) will decrease lipid solubility but it will also eliminate activity. R´´ in position 1 is usually, H but CH in that position yields less lipid solubility and duration. Exchanging S for O atom in position 2 produces thiobarbiturates, which are more lipid-soluble than the oxybarbiturates. In general, the more lipid-soluble the barbiturate, the more rapid its onset, the shorter its duration and the greater the degree of hypnotic activity. Barbiturates showed some hydrolytic problems in regard to formulation of liquid dosage forms. The difficulty is -OH catalyzed degration of the ureide rings but that can be fixed if the pH is 6 in the formulation. S(-) form of barbiturate have shown more depressant activity while the R(+) isomers have an excitatory effect.

According to research performed by Maddalena et al., using artificial neural networks, position 7 has the most effect on receptor affinity. When the active group in position 7 is made more lipophilic and the electronic charge is increased the receptor affinity increases. In the same study position 2´ was found to be the second-most important in affecting the affinity, but the group in that position needs to be electrophilic to have an effect. Positions 3, 6’ and 8 are of less importance. Changes to 6, 8, 9 or 4´ decrease activity. If the group in position 1 is changed to N-alkyl, haloalkyl, alkynyl and small cycle or aminoalkyl the activity is increased. Position 3 hydroxylation can cause rapid conjugation and decrease duration and potency, which can be clinically useful.

In the mid 1980s, the neuroactive steroids 3α,5α-tetrahydroprogesterone or allopregnanolone (3α,5α-THP) and 3α,5α-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (3α,5α-THDOC) were shown to modulate neuronal excitability via their interaction with GABA receptors. The steroids 3α,5α-THP and 3α,5α-THDOC were able to enhance the GABA-elicited Cl current. In addition, these steroids might enhance the binding of muscimol and benzodiazepines to GABA receptors. Structure- activity studies (SAR) showed that the 3alpha-OH group is essential for the anesthetic actions of these steroids, they also have an optimally-placed hydrogen bond accepting group on the β face of the steroid at the C-17 position. The four steroid rings form a rigid framework for positioning these hydrogen groups in three-dimensional space. Analogues 5 and 6 (Figure 10) are weak modulators of GABA receptor function because the flexible side chains in these analogues do not have the conformations required for high biological activity.

Sesotho kinship

Sesotho – the language of the Basotho ethnic group of South Africa and Lesotho – has a complex system of kinship terms which may be classified to fall under the Iroquois kinship pattern. The complex terminology rules are necessitated in part by the traditional promotion of certain forms of cousin marriage among the Bantu peoples of sub-Saharan Africa. Most of the terms used have common reconstructed Proto-Bantu roots.

Due to the importance of family, the terms are limited to relatives through birth (consanguinity) and marriage (affinity). Adoption – the modern legal variety or the older common-law/traditional variety – is no different from birth. Marriage is not distinguished from birth, except for the names of sons- and daughters-in-law, and the terminology treats relatives through marriage to be no different from relatives through birth.

The adoption of an Iroquois kinship system is necessitate by the fact that traditionally large families lived together in compounds, and married children rarely lived far from their parents. Thus, the nuclear family is far larger and comprises far more categories than the father-mother-children pattern which is common in modern European culture.

Iroquois systems make the most terminology distinctions in the generation of the "ego" (oneself) – one's siblings and cousins – and this generation's parents (mother/father and aunts/uncles) and immediate offspring (children and nephews/nieces). These are the generations directly involved in cousin marriage, and the seemingly complicated terminology shows a certain symmetry when one considers the difference between cross-cousins and parallel cousins.

Above these three strata, all relatives are grandparents, and below all strata are grandchildren – even in the face of a lack of direct ancestry or descent.

In Iroquois kinship systems, the complexity stems from promotion and/or prohibition of certain forms of cousin marriage, resulting in a form of symmetry called bifurcate merging where the parents of one's cross-cousins have a set of names different from the parents of one's parallel cousins.

Ones mother's female relatives of the same generation are considered one's mothers, and one's father's male relatives of the same generation are considered one's fathers. Moreover, one cannot marry their fathers' or mothers' children (siblings and parallel cousins), but is allowed/encouraged to marry every other relative of the same generation (cross-cousins). Additionally, the names of these relatives' spouses are dependent upon the names of the relatives, resulting in the seemingly nonsensical (to speakers of other Bantu languages) situation where the inherently gender-dependent terms and are unisex when used for one's relatives' spouses.

The Sesotho system displays a slight bit more complexity than the standard Iroquois systems in that, when it comes to one's mothers and fathers, the terminology further classes them based on relative age to one's biological parents.

In the chart below, vertical placement signifies relative age, with relatives above one's biological parents being older than one's parents, and vice versa.

! Relationship !! Name !! Explanation

The most complexity is displayed in the terms used by one to refer to male and female relatives in one's own generation. Immediate siblings and parallel cousins have similar terms, while cross-cousins all have a single name derived from the verb - ("give birth"), denoting the fact that cross-cousin marriage is encouraged.

The words used by ego when referring to his/her siblings depend on ego's gender, the relative age of ego's sibling, and whether ego is talking "about" their sibling (nominative) or "to" their sibling (vocative).

When speaking to the sibling directly, the names in the table above are used, but when directly speaking to a sibling younger than oneself it is more usual to use their name directly without a title prefix.
Additionally, the name may used when speaking about/to a younger sibling of the opposite gender.

For the generation directly below that of the ego, the names one uses for the children of one's siblings, cross-cousins, and parallel cousins are simply determined by whether or not one has the same gender as the relative on the same generation, who is the child's parent. In particular, all children who are related to the ego by a parent of the same gender as the ego are referred to as one's children, whereas everyone else from this generation is referred to by the generic term . Equivalently, if a child refers to ego as or , then ego refers to the child as .

If ego has married their motswala or even "sibling", then that relation's children – who are also ego's biological children – will simply be given the same name as ego's children without further complication.

The names used for ego's children are and , depending on the child's gender.

In summary, ego can marry a relative only if ego's parents call that relative . This bars marriage to parallel cousins as well as relatives in generations above and below oneself.

Regardless of direct descent or ancestry, all relatives in generations above ego's parents are called and for females and males respectively, and all relatives below ego's children are called . If the specific generation of one's grandchildren is important, then it can be marked by successively applying diminutive suffixes to the word , giving

In the vocative, relations through marriage are not distinguished from relations through birth/adoption. However, to avoid ambiguity, in the nominative there exist special terms for parents-in-law and children-in-law. It is worth noting that the terms for a female ego's parents-in-law literally mean "my (parallel) cousin's mother" and "my (parallel) cousin's father", even if one did not marry their cousin; this a relic of the traditional encouragement of parallel cousin marriage.

A male calls simply calls his parents-in-law "mother " and "father", but in the nominative a woman may call her in-laws by the gender-neutral term .

The generic term for a spouse is . More specifically, in the nominative a husband is and wife is (generic terms for "man" and "woman", respectively). In the vocative, and are used or – less formerly – the generic ("my spouse") is used.

Texas-Southern League

The Texas-Southern League was a minor baseball league that existed in 1888 and 1897.

The 1888 league had five teams: the Dallas Hams, Galveston Giants, Houston Babies, New Orleans Pelicans and San Antonio Missionaries. Dallas was the league champion. Notable players included George Stallings, Bill Joyce, Warren Wallace Beckwith and George Bradley, among others, played in the league that season.

The 1897 league consisted of eight teams: the Dallas Steers, Fort Worth Panthers, Galveston Sand Crabs, Sherman Orphans, Shreveport Grays, Austin Senators, Houston Magnolias and San Antonio Missionaries. Austin, Houston, San Antonio and Shreveport disbanded on August 6. First-place finisher Dallas faced second-place finisher Fort Worth in the playoffs, which was initially set to be a 15-game series but ended after game 13 with Fort Worth leading Dallas seven games to six. Fort Worth was declared the champion several months later. Notably, Ice Box Chamberlain and Harry Steinfeldt played in the league that season.

Sources indicate that a league played by that name in 1881 and 1897, though information about those leagues, if they existed at all, is sparse.

1955–56 Liga Alef

The 1955–56 Liga Alef season was the first in which Liga Alef was the second tier of Israeli football due to the formation of Liga Leumit, and was the first nationwide second tier season (replacing Liga Bet North and South regional divisions).

Hakoah Tel Aviv won the league and qualified for the promotion play-offs against Maccabi Jaffa (10th at the 1955–56 Liga Leumit).

League matches were completed on 2 June 1956, however, Hapoel Balfouria appealed against the results which were set in its matches against Hapoel Nahariya (a walkover loss of 0–3) and Hapoel Jerusalem (which was abandoned with a score of 4–0 to Hapoel Jerusalem), as Balfouria could be spared from relegation with two wins in these matches. The first replayed match was played on 28 July 1956, and as Hapoel Balfouria lost 2–4 to Hapoel Nahariya, Balfouria gave up its claims regarding the match against Hapoel Jerusalem, agreeing to set the score to 0–4 to Hapoel Jerusalem.

An 18th round match between Hapoel Nahariya and Beitar Jerusalem wasn't played due to misunderstanding between the teams regarding the time of the match, and was left unplayed at the end of the season.

Liga Alef winner, Hakoah Tel Aviv face Liga Leumit 10th-placed club, Maccabi Jaffa. The matches took place on June 10 and 17, 1956.

Maccabi Jaffa won 4–1 on aggregate and remained in Liga Leumit. Hakoah Tel Aviv remained in Liga Alef.

A promotion-relegation play-off between the 9th and 10th placed teams in Liga Alef, Ahva Notzrit Haifa and Beitar Jerusalem, and the winners of the regional divisions of Liga Bet, Maccabi Sha'arayim and Maccabi Hadera. Each team played the other three once.

Empire Mates Entertainment

Empire Mates Entertainment (abbreviated as E.M.E) was a Nigerian record label founded by Banky W and Tunde Demuren in 2002. It was home to recording artists such as Wellington himself and Niyola. DJ Xclusive was the label’s official DJ. Wizkid, Skales and Shaydee were all formerly signed to the label. Producers associated with the label include Masterkraft, Jay Sleek, Cobhams Asuquo, Spellz and Samklef, among others. On June 18, 2012, the label released its compilation album "Empire Mates State of Mind". In addition to establishing a record label, Banky W, Segun Demuren and Tunde Demuren established a production house, a publishing company known as Muzik Men Publishing, and a charity foundation known as the I-AM-CAPABLE Charity Foundation. Banky W announced in February 2018 that E.M.E was dissolved as a record label; he said the label is now a talent management company focused on creative marketing, advertising, PR and brand events.

Banky W and Tunde Demuren founded the record label in Albany, New York in 2002. During an interview with Beverly Bryan of MTVIggy.com, Banky W shed light on the formulation of E.M.E. He said he started E.M.E while studying at a local university in Albany. He also said he made money from singing to patrons of hair and nail salons in New York. In 2008, Banky W established E.M.E in Lagos after relocating there. In 2009, he signed Wizkid as the first act to the record label. Skales was also signed to the label in 2009. DJ Xclusive, Shaydee and Niyola were all signed to the label in 2012. In an interview with Toolz on Ndani TV's The Juice, Banky W spoke about the signing process for each artist on the label. He said he signed Niyola after hearing her sing in the bathroom at his sister's wedding. Moreover, he said he signed Shaydee after the singer opened for him at a show in Ilorin. Wizkid and Skales' record deals with EME came as a result of their musical exposure.

On February 20, 2013, InformationNigeria.com reported that Wizkid was at war with E.M.E due to matters that pertain to contract negotiations. According to the website's source, Wizkid was getting 25 percent from every show while Banky W and Segun Demuren were getting 50 percent. Osagie, Wizkid's former manager, was getting the remaining 25 percent. After firing Osagie and hiring Godwin Tom, Wizkid wanted a 50-50 share with Banky W. The source revealed that Banky W refused to accept Wizkid's proposal. Moreover, it was reported that Banky W wanted to find a manager for Wizkid who would accept 25 percent. It was also alleged that things started getting sour as a result of both parties' disagreement. Furthermore, it was reported that Wizkid was doing three shows weekly and bringing in close to ₦24 million monthly. Allegations about Wizkid's departure from EME kept getting coverage mainly because he (Wizkid) wasn't invited to Banky W's album launch party and wasn't featured on the "R&BW" album. In the aforementioned interview with Toolz, Banky W broke his silence on the subject. He said the situation was not as violent as people made it out to seem. Wizkid left the label following the release of his second studio album and expiration of his 5-year contract.

On February 19, 2014, "Nigerian Entertainment Today" reported that Skales parted ways with E.M.E following the expiration of his contract. According to the report, both parties met and reached an agreement. In May 2017, Shaydee announced his exit from the label following the expiration of his recording contract. 

E.M.E was nominated for Best Record Label of the Year at the 2013 City People Entertainment Awards.

The Romance of Sleepy Hollow

The Romance of Sleepy Hollow is a 1923 New Zealand film written and directed by Henry J. Makepeace, and produced and shot in Auckland. The film is now lost, with a poster the only surviving material. The poster says it is “A Bright Sparkling Comedy-Drama in Four Reels ... The first to be produced in New Zealand,”. The film was to open at “The Grand” theatre in central Auckland opposite the G.P.O. on 22 August 1924.

Sam Edwards says it may have been a melodrama set in Auckland, as the poster says "Maoriland Pictures presents Francis X. Bouzaid of Onehunga and June Phillips of Dominion Road" supported by four other local couples. It was shot on 35 mm, silent, and black & white. The film was submitted to the censor in November 1923, who required the removal of some 900 feet (around 15 minutes). This reduced it from 5700 feet to 4800 feet or about 80 minutes. Nothing now remains of the film apart from the poster.

Eugenius Nulty

Eugenius Nulty (1790 – July 3, 1871) was an Irish born American mathematician of the 19th century. He served on the faculty of Dickinson College from 1814 to 1816, and later taught and tutored prominent Philadelphians, including the brothers Mathew Carey Lea and Henry Charles Lea.

After arriving in the United States from his native Ireland, Nulty quickly became ensconced as a member of the new nation’s small intelligentsia. Contemporaries described him as “brilliant”.

In 1814, Nulty became a professor of mathematics at Dickinson College, where he remained for two years. In 1816 he moved to Philadelphia at the invitation of The Philadelphia Life Insurance Company and the Pennsylvania Company, who each recruited Nulty as one of the first U.S. actuarial scientists. His new countrymen also called Nulty to assist with mathematics for the U.S. Office of Coast Survey.

In 1817, Nulty was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society. In 1823, the University of Pennsylvania awarded Nulty an honorary A.M. He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 1832. Nulty was also a correspondent of mathematician, chemist and natural philosopher Robert M. Patterson.

Nulty contributed to the defunct "Mathematical Diary", one of the 3 earliest learned mathematical journals published in the U.S. His "Elements of Geometry, theoretical and practical" Philadelphia: J. Wetham (1836) was one of the first two or three original geometries published in the United States and is still over 150 years later available from multiple publishers in historical reprints.

In 1840, P.J. Walker, director of the National Institute for the Promotion of Science, called Nulty "unsurpassed at home or abroad" in pure mathematics.

<doc id="41069704" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41069704" title="Trams in Barcelona">
Trams in Barcelona

Historically, the city of Barcelona, in the Spanish autonomous community of Catalonia, had a large tramway network. The city's first tram line opened in 1872, but almost all of these historic lines had closed by 1971, being replaced by buses and by the expanding Barcelona Metro. The one remaining line, the Tramvia Blau, was retained as tourist attraction, utilising historic rolling stock. However at the beginning of the 21st century, two new tram systems, the Trambaix and Trambesòs, opened in the suburbs of the city.

The first tramway line in Barcelona was the "Barcelona-Gràcia (Josepets)", a horse tramway that opened by the "Barcelona Tramways" company on June 28, 1872. Within a few years, lines were built throughout Barcelona and many of its surrounding villages. As the tramways helped to integrate the metropolis, these villages became quarters of today's Barcelona.

Lines were built by a number of companies, but by the 1900s the two main companies were "Barcelona Tramways" and "Compañía General de Tranvías". Electrification took place in the 1900s, with the introduction of route numbers following from 1910 onwards. In 1925, the two main companies merged to "Tranvías de Barcelona" (TB). The Spanish Civil War (1936-9) caused major damage to the tramways.

Services recovered in the 1950s and 1960s, and double-decker trams were used to operate some services. In the early 1960s, a fleet of 101 PCC cars were purchased second-hand from the United States city of Washington and, after modification, placed in service in Barcelona.

However closures then started to happen. With the exception of the Tramvia Blau, the last two tramway lines operated on March 18, 1971. For the next thirty years or so, this one short line was the only tramway in Barcelona.

Towards the end of the 1980s a number of new tramways were opened in other European cities, and Barcelona started to consider the possibility of building new lines. To test this idea, in 1997 a short test tramway was built along the Diagonal with just two tram stops. Tests were conducted with a tram from the Grenoble tram system in June 1997, and a month later with a Siemens Combino.

The tests were successful, and the decision was made to build two new tram systems, both operating on parts of the Diagonal, although not interconnected. Both lines commenced operation in 2004, with TramBaix in the west starting on April 5, whilst Trambesòs in the east commenced on May 8.

The Tramvia Blau is a long heritage streetcar line serving a hilly area of the Sarrià-Sant Gervasi district. It links the Avinguda Tibidabo terminus of Barcelona Metro line L7 with the lower station of the Funicular del Tibidabo, thus providing part of a through link from the city centre to Tibidabo.

Tramvia Blau is operated by Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB), albeit not part of Autoritat del Transport Metropolità (ATM) and therefore not fare-integrated with the other public transportation networks of the metropolitan area; ticketing is paid cash only to the tram operators. The line is operated with a fleet of seven tram cars dating from between 1901 and 1906.

The Trambaix is a light rail (tram) system connecting the Baix Llobregat area with the city of Barcelona. It includes three routes (T1, T2 and T3), which have an inner terminus at Plaça Francesc Macià, to the west of the city centre, and extend west, passing L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Esplugues de Llobregat, Cornellà de Llobregat, Sant Joan Despí, Sant Just Desvern and Consell Comarcal in Sant Feliu de Llobregat.

The Trambaix is operated by the TramMet company and is part of the ATM network and is fare-integrated with the other public transportation networks of the metropolitan area. The line uses a fleet of Alstom Citadis trams.

Trambesòs is a light rail (tram) system, consisting of three routes that connect the district of Sant Martí in Barcelona to Badalona and Sant Adrià de Besòs municipalities. Its name comes from the union of the words "tram", an abbreviation of the Catalan word "tramvia", and "Besòs", the name of an area in northern Barcelonès dominated by river Besòs.

Like the Trambaix, Trambesòs is operated by the TramMet company and is part of the ATM network and is fare-integrated with the other public transportation networks of the metropolitan area. It uses the same type of rolling stock as the Trambaix system.

Habitica

Habitica, formerly HabitRPG, is an online task management application run by HabitRPG, Inc. Unlike most task management programs, Habitica takes the form of a role-playing game. Habitica is an open source project.

Habitica is a self-improvement web application with game mechanics overlaid to help the player keep track of and remain motivated to achieve their goals.

The game is laid out in the form of an RPG, in which the player collects items such as gold and armor to become more powerful. Rewards are achieved through maintaining real-life goals, in the form of "Habits", "Dailies" and "To-Dos".

In Habitica, "Habits" are long-term goals which are utilized to change a person's habits. These "Habits" can be set to either 'positive' or 'negative', or both. For example:

If a user completes a positive Habit often, it will turn green. This signifies that they are doing a good job following their Habit. On the other hand, if a user performs a negative Habit often, it will start to turn red and do increasing damage to their health. When players accrue enough experience points, they gain a level, which restores their health.

Habitica uses "Dailies" to track habits that the user wants to complete in a known, scheduled, and repeatable fashion. Dailies are completed by ticking a check box: the user sets their Dailies in advance, and checks off what they have completed during their day. Completed Dailies give the user experience and gold; Dailies that fail to be completed by the end of the day result in a loss of health.

"To-Dos" are one-time tasks that can be added or deleted. When a user completes a To-Do, they gain experience. The To-Do then disappears (it can later be found under the 'Complete' To-Dos tab). Unlike Habits and Dailies, To-Dos will never cause the user to lose health: the To-Do just becomes more valuable over time (it gives more experience and gold once completed).

A major part of Habitica is the role-playing aspect. A role-playing game is one in which a player takes on the role of another person or character. In Habitica, the user takes control of a character that they design themselves. The user can level up and unlock new features. However, upon death, various items and a level are lost.

The player can customize their own character (also known as an avatar) using various customization options such as hair, skin color and shirts. The armor and swords that a player buys when equipped also provide an attribute bonus. Some of the art in Habitica is sourced from BrowserQuest.

The class system is another feature adding complexity to the role-playing aspect of Habitica. Players can choose from one of four classes, each of which have different armor available, as well as different primary and secondary character attributes that affect gameplay.

Depending on how well a player completes their Habits, Dailies, and To-Dos, they either gain "experience" or lose "health". When a player obtains enough experience, they gain a level, but losing all their health will cause their character to die, and be set back a level. The higher the level the player is, the more features they have access to.

When a player completes a Habit, Daily, or To-Do, they gain Gold with the amount depending on the difficulty of the task. Gold can be used to buy "rewards" - which can either be user-defined, real life rewards, or equipment that can give boosts in-game. Gold used to be split into Gold and Silver, with hundred Silver making up one Gold

When checking off items, sometimes the player will receive an item. The items that can be found are eggs, color potions, and food. The player can combine these to collect a set of 90 pets, which they can display beside their avatar, and 90 mounts, which their avatar can ride. Additional pets and mounts can be obtained during special events and by completing quests.

Players can band together in parties to complete quests. Players can also join guilds and participate in challenges made by other players, where the person with the most consistency in performing a task wins an achievement. Players can compete with friends and strangers, as well as collaborate and focus on accountability. In parties and guilds, as well as in the community-wide Tavern, players can communicate with one another via chat.

There are four seasonal events called Grand Galas that happen each year in Habitica. Past Galas have involved new quests, special items such as limited edition equipment and avatar customization options, and bosses for the whole community to fight together. Other holidays, such as Valentine's Day and April Fools’ Day, are also celebrated.

An official mobile application named Habitica is available for the Android and iOS operating systems. These mobile applications are replacements for the deprecated mobile apps named HabitRPG, which were released as promised after the $25,000 Kickstarter fund goal was reached.

In reviewing the site, Alan Henry wrote for Lifehacker that "while it doesn’t offer the advanced features that many other to-do apps have, it’s certainly a blast to use, and really addictive". Kelsey Adams wrote for CNET that Habitica (then known as HabitRPG) 'had [her] at RPG', and describes 'how much more compelling a game can be than reality to those of us whose brains are bent that way'.

Tyler Renelle originally created HabitRPG to help with his own habits, having been inspired by the self-help books "The Power of Habit" and "The Now Habit". The earliest version of HabitRPG was a Google Docs spreadsheet with color-coded cell formulae.

As the community of HabitRPG users grew, Renelle reached out to Siena Leslie and Vicky Hsu. Leslie and Hsu became cofounders of HabitRPG, Inc., which was formally incorporated as a company in 2014.

On July 31, 2015, the website and apps were renamed to Habitica, after the land where players’ adventures take place. The change was made because some users found the name HabitRPG confusing or difficult to remember. The company name remained HabitRPG, Inc.

In addition to participating in the website and apps’ social aspects, the community has been involved in helping with and improving Habitica.

Community volunteers contribute to Habitica in various ways, such as by creating pixel art, translating text, creating music and sound effects, writing blog posts to promote Habitica, editing the wiki, resolving bugs, implementing new features, and answering new users’ questions.

Starting on January 11, 2013, Renelle started a campaign on fund-raising site Kickstarter to improve development of the application with a goal of $25,000. The goal was surpassed: $41,191 was raised by a total of 2,817 people.

Habitica's application programming interface (API) allows programmers to create third-party applications, extensions, and other tools that interface with Habitica.

<doc id="41069765" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41069765" title="Geography of Santa Maria, Bulacan">
Geography of Santa Maria, Bulacan

Santa Maria is a landlocked municipality in the province of Bulacan, Philippines comprising 24 barangays with a total land area of 90.925 square kilometers (35.106 sq mi).

The geographic location of Santa Maria may be regarded favorable with respect to its relative distance from the National Capital Region (NCR) and the Provincial Capitol. Lying at the eastern portion of Bulacan, which is just 32 kilometers away from Manila. In terms of location relative to its neighboring towns, Santa Maria is bounded on the north by the municipalities of Angat and Pandi; portion of San Jose del Monte City on the south; Norzagaray and other portions of San Jose del Monte City on the east; and municipalities of Marilao and Bocaue on the western side.

The topography of Santa Maria is generally flat, however, it is hilly towards the north. This area covers the barangays of Silangan, Mag-asawang Sapa, Pulong Buhangin and some parts of Balasing with landscape ranging from 8 to 18 percent slope. The rest of the barangays have a slope range from level to undulating. 
Network of small rivers can be found all throughout the municipal territory. Flowing downstream from the north, these tributaries converge into the Santa Maria River. This river plays a vital role in the physical configuration of Santa Maria and adjacent towns of Norzagaray and San Jose del Monte City as it drains water from these areas.

Santa Maria has a climate “first type” which is defined as having two pronounced seasons: Dry from November to April and wet during the rest of the year. During the dry months, precipitation is less because of the prevailing easterly wind blow to produce rainfall in its leeward side.

The Köppen climate system classifies Santa Maria climate as tropical monsoon (Am) due to its location and precipitation characteristics. This means that the municipality has two pronounced seasons: dry and wet seasons.

Santa Maria's most perceptible months start from May and may have its maximum in August, which gradually decreases until December. During these most months, thunderstorms and rain showers causes precipitation in May and June while the rest is primarily due to the southeast monsoon that prevails on this particular part of the year. Others which occur in November and December are caused by tropical cyclones that pass through the area.

The annual mean temperature in the area is . The warmest month is May with mean temperature of while the coldest is January at .

The mean annual relative humidity in the area is 77%, which is under a normal condition. The mean monthly relative humidity is lowest in March at 64% and highest in September at 84%.

The source of potable water of Santa Maria is purely dependent from its aquifer underneath it. Although the town is not rich in surface water, its ground water resources has sufficiently provide Santa Maria with their present requirement. Ground water in Santa Maria is essentially under shallow well areas, which means that fresh water can be easily found at a depth of about 20 meters below the ground surface. However, at present, potable water is sourced at 100 meters above. On the contrary, this finite resource has been badly contaminated by infiltration of sewage in some shallow wells at barangays San Jose Patag, Catmon, Pulong Buhangin, Santa Clara and Bagbaguin.

The soils in Santa Maria is classified under three (3) categories namely soils of the Alluvial Landscape, soils of the Piedmont Landscape and soils of the Hilly Landscape.

Soils range from clayey to fine clayey somewhat poorly to poorly drained deep soils. These soils are principally grown to paddy rice and can be used for fishpond during rainy season. This landscape is composed of two (2) minor landform units as follows:

Moreover, soil series of the Alluvial Landscape consists of the Batia and Tagulod Series. Both series has low to adequate organic matter content and inherent fertility. However, Batia Series can be found on a relative steeper slopes covering the barangays of Lalakhan, Bagbaguin and Santa Clara. Tagulod Series on the other hand, covers the barangays of Manggahan, Caysio, Caypombo, Camangyanan, Tumana and Parada which is regarded to be generally utilized under rice production during wet season.

It consists of gently undulating to rolling tuffaceous and sedimentary foot slopes slightly above and adjacent to the plain and free from local flooding hazard. This landscape, however, is composed of two soils series namely the Pulong Buhangin Series and Maysan Series. Pulong Buhangin Series has deficient organic matter content and high to moderate inherent fertility. This is principally utilized for paddy rice and built-up areas. Non-irrigated paddy rice constitutes the principal crop during wet season. These soils are left fallowed during dry season due to lack of irrigation and rainfall. These areas can be found in the central to upper portion of Santa Maria. Meanwhile, the Maysan series consists of very gently sloping to gently undulating shallow moderately drained soils that is formed on degraded tuffaceous sandstone footslopes. This series is mainly utilized for paddy ricefields during wet season and generally left idle during dry season

These soils are primarily in rolling sedimentary hills. The drainage is good with low to medium natural fertility. These areas can be found at barangays Pulong Buhangin, Mag-asawang Sapa, Balasing, Bulac, San Vicente and Guyong. These soils are primarily under pasture grass. Some cultivated areas are grown to diversified cropping.

Soil pH measures the level of acidity of the soil – the lower the pH, the more acidic the soil. Most parts of Santa Maria are medium acidic ranging from 5.6 to 6.0 pH. Includes the barangays of Silangan, Mag-asawang Sapa, Caypombo, Caysio, Manggahan, Santa Cruz, Poblacion, Guyong, Balasing, Bulac, Catmon, San Gabriel, San Vicente, Camangyanan and Buenavista. The barangays of Pulong Buhangin, Santa Clara, Lalakhan, Tumana and Parada are strongly acidic ranging 5.1 to 5.5 pH and slightly acidic for the barangay of San Jose Patag ranging from 6.1 to 6.5 pH.

Most parts of Santa Maria are low in phosphorus ranging from 0 ppm to 9 ppm. It includes the barangays of Silangan, Mag-asawang Sapa, Caypombo, Caysio, Manggahan, Santa Cruz, Santa Clara, Lalakhan, Poblacion, Guyong, Balasing, Bulac, San Jose Patag, Tumana, San Gabriel, Parada and San Vicente. Other barangays such as Pulong Buhangin, Camangyanan and Buenavista are medium in phosphorus ranging from 9.0 ppm to 20.0 ppm.

Most parts of Santa Maria are sufficient in Potassium ranging from 100 ppm and above. It includes the barangays of Mag-asawang Sapa, Santa Clara, Poblacion, Guyong, Balasing, Bulac, San Jose Patag, Parada, San Vicente, Camangyanan and Buenavista. However, Silangan, Caypombo, Caysio, Manggahan, Santa Cruz, Tumana, San Gabriel and Pulong Buhangin are deficient in Potassium ranging from 0 ppm to 100 ppm.

Guadalupe Formation is the major underlying geological structure present in the territory of the municipality of Santa Maria. This is made up of two formations namely Alat Conglomerate and Diliman Tuff. Alat Conglomerate is characterized by its consolidated pebbles, gravel or boulder beds composition. While Diliman Tuff is generally made up of an almost flat-lying sequence of vitric tuffs and welded volcanic breccias with subordinate amounts of tuffaceous, fine- to medium-grained sandstone. Based on this makeup, the whole area of Santa Maria is regarded to be very suitable to hold structures necessary for urban development.

The primary hazard or danger that can be brought by an earthquake is the effect of ground shaking. Buildings or properties can be damaged by the shaking itself or by the ground beneath them settling to a different level than it was before the earthquake. Santa Maria is fortunate to be free from fault lines. The nearest fault line is found at San Jose del Monte City which is just 17 kilometers away from its city proper. However, ground shaking can still be experienced by the town which can pose hazard to properties. Using the Rapid Earthquake Damage Assessment System (REDAS), the planning team was able to simulate the effect of ground shaking at Santa Maria if the nearest fault line located at San Jose del Monte City would move at magnitude 7 and 5 meter depth earthquake.

3rd Armoured Division (Syria)

The 3rd Armoured Division is a formation of the Syrian Army responsible for securing the northern approach to Damascus. The division is based in a military complex near Qutayfah and has traditionally been seen as one of the Assad Government's most reliable conventional Divisions.

The division is part of the Syrian Army's 3rd Corps, and is composed of 47th Armoured Brigade, the 65th Armoured Brigade, the 81st Armoured Brigade, the 21st Mechanized Brigade, and an unknown Artillery Regiment.

As of 2011 the division was under the command of Maj. Gen. Naim Jasem Suleiman. The 65th Brigade was under the command of Brig. Gen. Jihad Mohamed Sultan.

The division, under General Shafiq Fayadh, played a key role in defeating the Muslim Brotherhood uprising in the 1980s. During the conflict the entire Division was deployed to Aleppo in March 1980, and garrisoned the city for an entire year. Patrick Seale wrote on how the division had "a tank in almost every street.” Seale also wrote of an incident where General Fayadh stood on the turret of a tank and proclaimed that “he was prepared to kill a thousand men a day to rid the city of the vermin of the Muslim Brothers.”

The division was also used in the Government assault on Hama, with the division's 47th Armoured and 21st Mechanized Brigades providing the backbone of the assault.

Muslim Brotherhood reports following the uprising suggested that three quarters of the officers, and a third of the soldiers of these brigades were Alawites.

The division, under Fayadh, also played a key role in blocking an attempted coup in 1984 by Rifaat al-Assad. The 3rd Division, along with Ali Haydar's Special Forces and the Republican Guard, engaged with Rifaat's Defence Companies in Damascus. While the Special Forces deployed anti-Tank platoons on the streets of Damascus to confront Rifaat's armoured columns and surrounded Rifaat's bases with snipers, Fayadh's armoured forces provided the armoured back-up and firepower to completely insulate Damascus from the outside, so that Defense Company units outside of Damascus ( in Lebanon and further north) could not come inside Damascus, and the 30,000 or so of Rifaat's forces within the environs of Damascus were effectively trapped.

Human Rights Watch accused the division of involvement in the suppression of protests at the beginning of the Syrian Civil War. Specifically, the division was alleged to have been involved in the violent suppression of protests in Douma and Daraa in April 2011. In Douma, the division was allegedly involved in arbitrary arrests, the looting of homes, and the shooting of unarmed protesters.

The division has since been involved in the Rif Dimashq Governorate campaign.
